The work will come with pressure and deadlines but in time. You’re in a very good place since you’re getting paid to learn.

There's very few \"pure anything\" jobs. IMO, the majority of SWE jobs on the market require a \"thick skin generalist mindset\".\n\nAlso, life as a SWE can contain a lot of \"helping project managers / business analysts talk with clients / users to figure out their business needs, gather requirements, create estimates, etc.\" As well as a plenthora of other things that make the job more draining than it feels like it should be.\n\nReally, I think your friend is going to need to focus on finding the right role at the right company.

Recently, Google has been moving a lot of their departments from the US to Dublin, Munich, India, Mexico and that sparkled the debate. What's your stance on it?  ",
   "Top Comments": "Most of the engineering team (including myself) was laid off from a startup at the end of April. They're replacing us by outsourcing because it's cheaper.; The place that laid off 30% of its staff last month has been trying to hire in South America; There should be huge tax penalty for this; Europe has better laws to protect the workforce.; My stance is something needs to be done but it’s likely nothing will and it will only get worse. \n\nUnless people start fighting back, companies will continue to fuck U.S. citizens over for profit.; I think people would be very disheartened if they saw the magnitude that this practice is used in the US health insurance industry. The business model is essentially to take government subsidies and make Americans pay out of pocket to the maximum extent possible, all while employing as few Americans as possible. It’s BS to see so many new grads drowning from the current market conditions as they face mountains of student debt with minimal job prospects, and then watch internally as my company slashes hundreds of new grad roles (among others) and move those exact same roles to other countries. And I know that we’re not the only ones doing the exact same thing either.\n\nPeople love to fall back on the argument of, “well that’s capitalism for you”, but I’ve honestly never heard anyone advocate for complete laissez-faire capitalism. Everyone has thresholds for places where government intervention is necessary, and this is one place that the government absolutely should intervene with participants in the US economy. I’m a firm believer in the importance of private, competitive markets, but I do draw the line at the point where you don’t proportionally employ people from the country whose economy your business relies on (or even come close to doing so). And especially so when your business leeches taxpayer dollars and generates the vast majority of its revenue from those same taxpayers. \n\nThis extends beyond just IT jobs (as well as beyond health insurance industry as I’ve been talking about), but obviously that’s the focus of this particular thread and health insurance is the industry I can speak about most accurately. And to answer your original question directly, OP: yes it is true, and it’s a garbage practice that needs to be corrected. It directly takes opportunities away from Americans and ruins the QoL for the people who remain employed but have to go to wildly unreasonable extents to do their job because their day to day work is now so tightly coupled with colleagues whose time zones are 12 hours apart.; didnt we beat this dead horse like last week? go visit the earlier threads there is thousands of comments; TBH I don’t know why they haven’t been doing that already for 10 years. There are so many legal and social barriers that prevent top talent from moving to the US. FAANG companies can pay 0.3-0.7 of their US salaries and still get equivalent quality of workers.; Should be a huge tax penalty doing this; Of course. A really good engineer without management responsibilities in Germany makes €150k. Other engineers make less.\n\nCompare that to California salaries.\n\nThen Europeans don't need the same amount of supervision as projects in India. \n\nUS engineers must produce significantly more per $ than other counterparts. Against India it is usually doable, against Europe, I am not so sure.; As a south American software dev, I’ve been working for USA companies for the last 8 years. They pay me less than a murican, but it’s still x4 that I would make working for a national company. Win-win\nNothing new; In Europe, we earn much less, for us 100k-150k $ a year is really good salary for senior engineer. But for company it's much harder to lay off, you need to show what employee did wrong for long period of time. Employees are really protected here + social part is fine, medical etc, so we are satisfied even if we are getting paid 3-4 times less then our US friends. Also US companies like EU because we are similar to you. For example I'm working in the dev team for one of the largest US banks and they prefer to have colleagues from EU rather then India or other parts of Asia.; people do what's best for themselves\n  \nthat includes the candidate side\n  \nthat includes the company side; Offshoring has been a thing since the very start of this industry. It's been going on for many decades. None of this is new.\n\nPeople new to the industry panic when they see their first big offshoring event... but those of us that have been in the industry for any amount of time are used to this. This is business as usual.\n\nYou realize Google offshored before this point, right? They're just offshoring *again*.\n\nBig companies were offshoring whole departments in 1990, and they're offshoring whole departments now. They'll eventually realize they fucked their code base up, and bring things back onshore. It's very cyclical.\n\nThe jobs being offshored are not the jobs that we're competing for here in the US.; In India a factory that moved was paying ENGINEERS  100 per MONTH  when word got out they burned the factory down think about that for a moment 100 per month workers were paid 5-13 per month \n\nMany factories moved to China where they were paying 91 cents per day; If your job can be done fully remotely while you’re also doing your dishes and cleaning your apartment, there’s no reason your job needs to be paying a US-level salary.\n\nCold hard truth some of you all don’t want to hear. You fully remote employees are not all as irreplaceable as you think you are.; Yes, outsourcing is cheaper, they can pay some of these people less than $10 an hour to do what they consider, the same work.; I kinda see that around too, not in my company per se, but realistically my company has a TTL in the current configuration. But in my SO's previous two companies, **lots** of outsourcing. A bit unnerving tbh.; Probably, I watched mine do it and continue to do it.  It's not just CS, any remote job and even some manufacturing.; One example, Apple requires developers working on the new iPhone web browsers to be physically located in Europe so that is probably some people they need in Europe?"

But if i have 2 offers in definitely going to consider a recent layoff as a blemish.; Possibly, I would ask the reason for the layoffs, specifically which departments. A lot of people think of layoffs as money saving actions. In reality, it's more of a reallocation of where the money is being spent. It's very common to lay off advertising teams, sales teams, processing teams, and then spend some portion of that money you saved on technical teams. When you do that, you're driving the business forward by investing in areas that innovate, while right sizing the operations with the current market. Sometimes you will even see it within the sales team, where you'll lay off a handful of sales people, and then higher another set of sales people. This is usually because the second set of sales people have a different demographic that they access, or potentially are just better at selling more lucrative products.; Hmm\n\nI think you need to use your best judgement in terms of figuring out if the position could be laid off. \n\nI would ask to speak to your potential new boss honestly about it. If it’s a weird conversation don’t take the job. Good managers shouldn’t have any issue discussing this.; Better to work for a company that just had layoffs than one that is about to have layoffs.; I mean it's always better to join after layoffs than before, ya know? I would be a little suspect as to why they are hiring soon after doing layoffs. You don't want to join if they are doing some kind of \"layoffs and hiring every year to cycle through poor performers\" system.; I had an amazingly cushy job and I left it for more pay. I found a huge qc error in the way things were being done after a couple of mo ths of working there. Was fired for it. I whole heartedly regret that job change.\n My career would have gone in a completely different direction; I don't view layoffs as an inherent red flag, I look at the context.\n\nDoes this company do annual layoffs (like Cisco)? Have they done several other layoffs leading up to this? Or is this a one-off event?\n\nWere the layoffs because of the company bleeding money? Or a strategic re-org? Or something else?\n\nWhy are they still hiring after doing layoffs? That signals to me that the layoff was strategic, and wasn't based in profitability.\n\nThese are the kinds of questions you should *ask your recruiter.* You should be reverse interviewing them. Don't be afraid to ask the hard hitting questions.\n\nMy new grad company did a layoff I think about 1 year into my employment there. I dusted off my resume, but stuck it out. I didn't get laid off, and I enjoyed 2.5 more very happy years at that company before I left of my own volition. A layoff doesn't inherently mean a company is fucked.; That's like describing every public company. There's always risk involved.

Then a nurse.; As someone who has done a lot of hiring, I feel that the interview success rate for bootcamp grads is far, far lower than traditional STEM grads.

Makes sense from an ethics pov really; which bootcamps are you referring to?; From a business sense too, their reputation would probably tank if they keep taking money and pumping out people who have no hope of getting a job.; I see your point if you talk about first (and often only) job instead careers.\n\nI think that a smart move is to get in while the market is bad so, when the job market gets better, you already have some practiced skills while everybody else is starting from scratch, you have virtually no competition from other candidates and you can ride the boom from the beginning instead of trying to jump in the middle or near the end.\n\nBut I guess that I can see that a lot of students wouldn’t want to do this and that the bootcamp wouldn’t want to provide this.; Or they have no customers and are shutting down that part of the business while saving face.; You seem to be glossing over the fact that getting into the market when it’s bad is very difficult.

   "Title": "How to let go of this \"perfectionistic\" mindset in Software Development?",
   "Top Comments": "Consciously develop a trade off mindset.; I rarely hear this discussed. It is heresy to challenge the beliefs of people who are heavily invested in process.\n\nIn general, I agree with your point. In my decades of experience, form gets confused with function. Process gets confused with product. There is a purity trap that non-creative, non-visionary people fall into. It's the work around the work that eats into and gets confused with innovation and quality.\n\nKeep in mind though, the best coders refactor their own code, constantly. But there should be a productive goal - efficiency, stability, ease of maintenance, etc.  Unfortunately, there is rarely any tolerance for this under the pressures of modern software delivery. \n\nI will get crucified for saying this, but C++ has not helped things.  I often compare it to Latin, roundly proclaimed as the best, most expressive language in human history. Mastering the elegant complex grammar of Latin takes a decade or more. Latin was used to divide the elite ruling class with time and means to learn it, from the lower working classes of civilization. The privileged few that spend a lifetime learning Latin will never stop talking about how perfect it is, lol. However, when the plain English version of that story is half the size and conveyed twice as fast, I don't want to hear about purity.\n\nBloated, slow, poor performing, behind schedule code can be one result of the perfectionist mindset.; We are making a big deal out of clean code and our editors because they are a big deal. If I have my editor set up correctly with all the extensions and shortcuts that I need, I will be far more productive. This more than makes up for the day or so that I spend configuring it\n\nClean code is discussed so much because it is important. You will read far more code than you will write, so when you read code, you want to to be clean so that you don't have to spend an inordinate amount of time piecing everything together. What \"clean code\" is, is a matter of debate sadly, because most people have some idea of what it should be. However, we have all worked in unclean codebases, so we have a good idea of what clean code isn't and that's the starting point for most discussions\n\nThere is nothing perfectionist about this. This is normal software development\n\nHowever, if you feel that you are spending too much time on these things and that you don't have any time left to actually build things, then maybe something else is at play. You are correct in that we are often bad at spotting defects in our own code, but checking that code over and over again is not a very effective way to find those defects. There are better ways to do it that may even play into that perfectionist mindset\n\nDo you write tests for your own code? If not, then you should. It's a great way to find defects in your code. It also forces you to think about what could go wrong, which helps to uncover things that you never thought of when you wrote that code. And tests also help you write better code; The “perfect” choice is whatever most appropriately meets business goals based on resources available. And those resources include team members with existing skill sets, knowledge bases, and aptitudes.\n\nWhen you accept that premise, optimizing stuff like editor choice or programming language is suboptimal.; I haven't experienced this myself personally. I think a trap that many people fall into is \"going through the motions of completing tasks or writing code\" without stopping to ask why or thinking about \"is there a better way to solve this problem\". From Sr SWEs I've talked to, they generally seem to view problems as a business problem instead of just an engineering problem.\n\nWe should change our incentives to optimize on being effective and thinking about our customers/stakeholders instead of obsesssing over \"how many JIRA tickets should you get done\" or \"deadlines\"; You need a senior dev to be on the same page. This perfectionist thing is kind of silly because your own notion of \"good\" code will evolve as you grow. \n\n>Or the idea that we talk so much about \"good practices\" as it has been with the whole \"Clean Code\" movement, so much that we don't talk about the importance of trying different approaches, asking more questions, or simply valuing experimentation over whether or not a code base followed SOLID.\n\nYou can do both. I emphasize code readability over stuff like linting. I don't see how this prevents you from asking questions though?; Ooh I got a story for ya. I’m at a Jr level and we’ve got one mid-level and 2 Senior devs in our company. I got assigned a task and finished it. The Sr said it looked great and was actually better than he would’ve done it. I made sure to adhere to our standards for variable, method names, test coverage etc. but the one mid-level guy in his quest for perfectionism (or maybe trying to polish his resume or suck up to the seniors) ended up re-writing my code to the point that it didn’t look anything like what I had written. He took another week after I put in my merge request to re-write MY code on a critical bug. I lost all my confidence that week because he kept pointing out in stand-ups he was “fixing” my stuff and also felt like if he was going to re-do my work anyway, why should I bother working anyway. Might as well chill if you’re going to do my work for me anyway. \nSo please keep this in mind too when you’re trying to be a perfectionist; You can be experimental without cutting corners.\n\n\"No customers are going to see it anyways\" is how the business guys try to undermine devs (ie: budget) and I'm surprised to see it being shared by a dev.\n\nYes, whether you create maintainable, scalable code or not is irrelevant to the business goals if it works either way.\n\nUntil the moment you actually need to maintain or scale, then suddenly business guys are going to be all over you asking why you didn't build everything perfectly from the start so that the business can handle the extra 10x, 100x, 1000x customers that are now upset it's not working as smooth as THEY promised.; Pretty interesting. What was the feedback from the seniors after? Did they agree that his work was correct and more accurate?\n\nWhat did he fix that he believed was considered perfection?; Before I started working on the ticket, we had all agreed that there are no great solutions to the issue because it was a wider architectural level issue and nothing substantial could be done about it without tearing down our entire architecture. So we choose the next best solution.\n\nI had a 1-1 with our senior dev and told him what had happened. He said he’s aware that the guy is a perfectionist. He went on to send a team wide slack saying we shouldn’t let perfection be the enemy of good. I believe he also had a talk with the guy and it feels like he had backed off since and had become more constructive in MR reviews. \n\nOh and the senior went back and looked at both our solutions and said it literally didn’t matter because side both were correct and patched the issue at hand. He was a bit mad that it took an extra week. Issue at hand: Handling messages from a messaging queue for a particular topic. I chose to abstract it out to a general messaging class which could be extended in case we needed to handle other messages. He chose to simply handle it within an existing class…"

And also, for me live codings are stressful.\n\nIf i do it they might have me in their database and it will say \"did quite poorly\". Is it in this case better to cancel it (2 - 3 days before) by saying just got an offer which is more suitable for the moment. What are your thoughts? I want to keep my chances in case they have job offerings in the next 6 months to a year."

Sure, there will always be others to which it seems to come naturally, but you don't need to be like that to be an effective developer\n\nA lot of work in this field isn't actually programming. It's communicating about work, discussing requirements and proposing solutions. Not all solutions require programming either. Some just require talking to the right people. Being able to see solutions that are bigger than just a piece of code will set you apart from other devs; Quality assurance. Along the whole testing process it is a big advantage if you understand code.; SDET? Product Manager?; You can be system performance dude.; Get into Appsec, you already know what sucks. Learn what’s insecure and go nuts; That depends on why you are not a good dev.; Go into SAPUI5. It's basically copy paste XML views from their documentation and some JS. I was given 3 months to ramp up in it by myself and was shadowing bug fixes for a company. Then was assigned as a full time dev for a big French company.; Go into project management; A bad dev can be an excellent project manager.; How long have you been working as a software developer?; i heard welding is the next big thing; I truly appreciate your response, but lets say Im pretty solid at communicating and discussing (not the best at proposing tbh lol).

On the other hand, the people who do find a job tend to stay silent (you are the exception). Granted, it's definitely true that the job market is worse these days, especially at entry level (layoffs->saturation have given employers all the control and is a full 180 from the market we saw back in 2021/early 2022). But finding a job now isn't impossible, as can be seen in your case.

But it's not universal advice and most people too mediocre to make it in CS probably can't hack it in trade work either.; So you kinda admit that you bypassed most people's situations. Those who got laid off and have families can't just up and go to the Netherlands (and a lot of them uprooted to the suburbs with less jobs to raise one to work remote since companies were promising those roles for years to come), nor can new grads suddenly gain YoE or have the funds to move abroad.; Yep, that's one way of saying it. I'm *very* mobile and have funds saved up from my previous position. Plus, I also have a year and a half of freelance technical writing experience specifically for QA spheres.; Yeah, I mean I'm in the same position, but I do know many many people in SF who have been unemployed for 1-2 years due to the above circumstances, also this area is unique in that companies are actually investing in processing costs for AI over hiring new engineers (GPT costs 700k+ to run a day etc).

Some companies don’t allow remote work in some states.\n\nThen she needs to work out policy issues, how many times and how long she needs to be at the office, travel cost reimbursement, etc.; >could simply asking the manager about this potentially harm her?\n\nProbably not, as long as she's asking about the options/procedure.; > My concern is: could simply asking the manager about this potentially harm her?\n\nIt will only hurt her if the environment or management is toxic.  I assume that is not the case if it is her dream job.  \n\n She should feel comfortable going to her current manager and saying something along the lines:\n\n> There is a possibility I may be moving, because of my spouse's career. Nothing is set in stone yet, but I wanted to discuss options to do so without losing this job; Welcome to the world of marriage. You both need to talk to each other or get counseling to decide what is best for both of you. You can't reasonably expect her to give up her job and career and follow you around without a plan. It's either you take the job she follows you and risks being fired for breaking their policy. \n\nNow it's not as simple as well it's remote she can do it anywhere. Does her company have a buisness license in the new location if it's a different state? How do the state income tax work? It's not as trivial as dumb policy especially if working in a different state. She would need to tell her employer her residence. I can say she will get fired for moving and not telling her employer.; Does her company have presence in the other state or allow fully remote work from anywhere in the US? If the manager doesn't care, the main issue to check is if the company would probably care about the tax implications.; With companies, things can be negotiated more than people think. But there is no way of knowing if your wife’s manager and company will allow it or how to convince them because we don’t know them.\n\nFirst do a thought experiment of you not moving, you moving and her staying, and you moving and her coming with and losing her job.\n\nIf certain options are off the table, like you have to move for this new job and she has to come with you (no 2 places of residence).\n\nThen you say well she will come no matter what so we take our best shot with the manager.\n\nTry to research if others in the company work in that state, other people with an exceptions to the wfh. Try to understand strings to pull with the manager. As others said, the state matters but it sounds close. So perhaps offer to commute the distance see if you can do less frequent but longer trips etc. if you have a good manager you can hopefully level with them and they’ll work with you. If not then it’s ok, a jobs just a job do what’s best for the family unit.; Had a similar situation happen to me. I would say approach the conversation honestly. See what they’ll allow in terms of hybrid (weekly, monthly, quarterly appearances in office). For me, my team was mostly in another location in the northeast (I’m in Florida), so for me it was agreed that so long as I was in office when my managers from the west coast were in, I was good (which they go there maybe once every quarter or two for less than a week); who makes more money?; yes; Let me add a correction.

   "Top Comments": "have you considered that “easy coding quiz” is a terrible way to interview someone also?  there are other ways to vet a candidate much better than these 2 options; Dang, that’s a low hanging straw man. Vomit is the best pizza topping because donkey shit is statistically worse? \n\nMaybe they should start testing reasoning skills at FAANG.; Someone didn’t listen during stats 101.; If your other company is not paying FAANG salary, then it’s not a fair comparison because it’s not attracting top engineers.; If that’s the extent of your data, you need to take a research methods course. At the most simplistic level, correlation != causation…; what the fuck is this post; Hard to argue with a sample size of two and such an unassailably rigorous testing methodology...  Sir, I congratulate you!; I've seen a lot of people say that leetcode style interviews aren't the best way to interview, but I've never seen people suggest alternatives that don't seem worse. (I'd love to hear about them if anyone has any!)\n\nWhen a candidate solves a challenging programming puzzle in an interview, you know that a) they're fluent in a programming language, and b) either they're really smart, or they're conscientious and studied hard enough that they saw the problem before and remembered how to solve it. Which is much more predictive of job performance than just being charismatic, which is all *most* kinds of interviews seem to really measure.\n\nI think it's nice to be in an industry where getting a job is based on a skill you can practice, where it's similar to what you do on the job, and interview performance can be measured fairly objectively.; I have sat on a few hiring committees. \n\nYou would be surprised at the amount of people that leetcode perfectly but in the end can’t code their way out of a paper.\n\nThe industry has created interview test prep sub industries….; I have also previously worked at a company that doesn't use leetcode, and right now I am at a company that heavily uses it. I would also agree that on average there is a difference.\n\nI think there is some self selection in that highly motivated individuals are more likely to master leetcode in the first place.\n\nEven as an experienced dev I would much prefer some standard leetcode question rather than getting grilled on obscure questions about a framework or a language. It goes the same way with leetcode as well. It is absolutely frustrating when an interviewer chooses to use a poorly designed question that should not be used within the constraints of an interview setting.\n\nFor the most part I think people just blame leetcode because the interview process, regardless of testing method, is anxiety inducing.; I hate studying for LC but I agree, some really stupid people fall through the cracks when companies don't use LC. Although the compensation for non-LC roles is usually way lower so they don't give enough of af to use LC probably. Amazon used to have a better system by making it easy to get in but shit candidates get immediately pip'd, but the volume of applicants vs openings is fucked now so they ask LC medium/hard too.; So one is A FAANG and one isn't?\n\nFAANG companies normally have a much better talent pool because of the brand recognition and comp. So if you're comparing a FAANG to a non FAANG, what you're seeing is the difference between someone who is applying to a 200k job and a 100k job.\n\nMuch less to do with the evaluation and a lot more to do with what the candidate pipeline looks like.; Leetcode tests weren't put up in place with the expectation that the candidate would grind these for days, weeks, but that's how this currently works out in practice. ; I've only done a few examples before saying \"this is stupid\", but what I feel its flaws are that the highest level solutions are optimized for global scale companies like google.\n\nIf you are rolling your own addition and subtraction library that stores numbers as linked lists, then maybe you are a good fit for Google and Amazon, but at my small midwest non-tech business you aren't going to be moving at the speed we need.\n\nWe need someone who can quickly find nuget, python, or node packages and glue them together and stand up a working solution in under a week.  I don't need you to spend 40 hours removing 40 clock cycles from an algorithm.\n\nThe solution you are building for me will be run twice a month by a dozen people.  I can afford to run 6 seconds slower if it gets stood up 1 week sooner.; I despise Leetcode. Think it's an incredibly dumb way to analyze an applicant.\n\nOnly reason why I study it is to then demand an insanely high salary.\n\nWhen an interviewer says there's a Leetcode portion, I then ask bluntly what the salary rate for the role is. If the pay is low then it's not worth the time to continue onto the Leetcode portion because that's not what I'm grinding Leetcode for. I'll then end the interview on spot. No Leetcode assessment, then no problem.\n\nIf there's a Leetcode portion that tells me you're a wannabe FAANG and that tells me to attack your pockets mercilessly because you'll pay like they do.; Your argument that \"LC is the best methodology\" suffers from tunnel vision and easily contradicts itself if you simply consider that L6+ interviews rely more heavily on system design and behavioral sessions; It's the difference between someone who crams for finals and squeeks by (LC), and someone who actually learned the material. Everyone here always goes on about how much LC grinding they did (even practicing  the very questions they expect to be asked). I'm amazed FAANG companies let themselves be gamed that way. Cramming/grinding LC isn't going to show how creative someone is, or allow them to demonstrate complex problems they solved that aren't as clearly defined as the LC exercises. \n\nYour estimation seems pretty subjective and I doubt very much that LC is the difference in quality you are seeing. Maybe people willling to grind LC endlessly do well in the particular very siloed environments at a FAANG or something, where everyone is a very very tiny cog in a vast machine.; Leetcode is invented to remove/reduce mediocre applicants, not to identify geniuses.; > there are other ways to vet a candidate much better than these 2 options\n\nHow do you vet candidates? I think a lot of interviewers would be happy to hear of better options; The other company had three interview segments: the first was an \"easy coding quiz\", the second focused on system design but mostly involved discussing my past work related to system design, and the third was purely behavioral. The FAANG one, on the other hand, had five interview rounds, each combining a behavioral question with a medium-difficulty LeetCode questions."

There are a lot of jobs in that. I’m an RN. I have good job security and I make low six figures. The pay is highly dependent on location and you’ll make a lot more in any state touching the Pacific. I haven’t met any doctors who are a doctor as a job. It is a lifestyle to them - I’ve never met one who works less than 50 hours a week and usually a lot more. I also am away from home for a lot of holidays, emotionally exhausted often, and hospitals are often toxic places to work - you’ll be gaslit all the time by admins and you’ll often have 1.5 hours of work to do every hour and under a lot of pressure to get it all done and there’s always more. You get screamed at by patients and their family members, deal with doctors or other specialties who either don’t care are too overworked to, exposed to all kinds of infectious diseases even the scarier ones (and we all now know that hospitals don’t really care and are just going to change policies to align with whatever they have available and not whatever is safe)….\n\nI don’t know what tech is like but that’s why I’m here. I’m considering a change in careers and I’m not sure which direction to go in. I won’t make any recommendations to you but I will say that I would try steering my kid away from the medical field if she was interested. For the sake of her being a happy person. But it has been kind to me in terms of financial stability. I’m not rich but I have hobbies I can afford and so forth.; From what I know of the medical route, it takes about 13 years (4 years undergrad, 4 years med school, 5 years residency) until you’re making good money + average debt is 250k+\n\nmaybe there’s alternative routes in that field. Idk, just saying you should do some research into the time and costs if you haven’t already."

   "Top Comments": "To me Programming was like algebra. It took me a longer than normal time for everything to click, but once it did I loved it. I honestly didn't know how to use a debugger until my senior year. FML; It's like a completely different skill set.\n\nIn class we had to write out our code on paper, had no notes, etc.\n\nIn real life, you're expected to search for existing solutions online, have an IDE, and you're blindsided by incorrect comments that your predecessors have left as a trap card.; In college I took the intro C++ class that was required for all freshman engineers. I didn't like it and wrote off pursuing anything with programming as my major. After college though I had a blast discovering I could write VBA macros to make spreadsheets super powerful. Eventually that lead me to Python and Data Science. Now I'm getting an MS in CS. I wish I had realized in college that a CS degree would've been best for me and made my life so much easier down the line.; If you didn’t like c++ that’s ok since there are plenty of other languages out there. If you don’t like programming…idk. SQL isn’t really something you use by itself, at least not in my experience.; I loved the people in school, but I wasn’t a fan of the classes. I love the work in the profession, but I am not a fan of the most of the people I’ve worked with throughout my career. I really dig into my own projects and lose myself in them - it’s like a euphoric feeling where I leave reality and time is gone instantly.; Personally I grew up programming. The classes were dull enough that I'd finish assignments and spend the rest of class messing around with the libraries or dev boards.\n\n\nSome of the least skilled instructors accused me of academic dishonesty/cheating, but the better instructors saw how easily I was keeping up with the topics and didn't mind me doing side projects in class. The dean seemed to dislike me a bit and I was kinda done with paying for a degree I wasn't being challenged by so I dropped out and worked for a while.\n\n\nI really enjoyed working, but startups don't have much slack to fit entry level staff so I was on the chopping block with others on my teams when the interest rates skyrocketted. Now I'm just skipping the diploma and finishing a proper degree at a different post secondary. They assessed me pretty much where I understood my skills to be; qualified for 2 years of post secondary, entering as a 3rd year student. I'll have fun and that's probably closer to my skill level.; You might try doing things in another modern language like c#, kotlin or swift. Many of the annoying things you have to deal with in c++ aren't there and you can just focus on the logic fundamentals instead of syntax quirks.\n\nOne of the things I disliked about intro classes was a lack of context for the assignments. Like, sure printing out ascii shape art teaches you about loops, but who cares?\n\nBut if you don't like the logic, or the math that comes with the advanced theory classes, the CS  degree might not be your things. There are still lots of important developer adjacent jobs though related to product development.; Well, in your career, you get to choose what jobs that you apply for.  If you don’t like C++, don’t apply for C++ jobs; apply for Python jobs.  If you don’t like coding at all, apply to product manager jobs or IT jobs.  The CS degree is meant to give you access to more opportunities, not be a straight jacket to force you to be a SWE.; You probably didn’t like it because you weren’t good at it. It’s okay. Keep going. It will click eventually.; Hell yes I actually paid my buddy to do my programming assignments in school, I went for statistics so I only had to take 2 programming classes. Then I ended up getting a job in IT right before I graduated, about a year after I finished my last programming class in college. I enjoyed it and my friend ended up going into a totally different field and now I'm a developer and he's not which is pretty funny. He was really good too but he hated his first job when he got out of college. Funny how things work out; I struggled through my classes involving Java at university, did most of my programming in python for the next few years and now have worked as a C++ dev for several years (and enjoying it). Sometimes understanding comes via a circuitous route.; While especially on reddit many people will tell you that programming is math and so on... and while this might make some sense theoretically... in practical terms I found most people are leaning either towards one or the other.\nI did a vocational school, a bachelor, a master, a BSc, taught at university and a small college with an applied focus.\nAnd have seen that again and again with colleagues and students.\nMost just want to program and somehow survive the mathy classes.\n\nI've got to know super-smart physics PhDs working in sister who definitely wouldn't lack the raw intelligence to be good programmers... but somehow they just can't be wired to appreciate the code. To then it's often just a translation of equations so they don't need it to be well-structured or readable as they look at the equations to understand it, not the code itself. \n\nI remember the first time reading about this in Levy's book Hackers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution) and asked GPT about it\n\n\"Yes, Steven Levy also describes two distinct classes of hackers based on their primary interests and skills:\n\n\n1. **The \"Real Programmers\"**:\n   - These hackers are deeply focused on the practical aspects of programming and building systems that work efficiently. They often emphasize hands-on coding and the ability to solve complex problems through innovative software solutions.\n   - Real Programmers are usually more interested in the direct application of their skills to create functioning programs and systems. They often take pride in writing code that is both efficient and elegant.\n\n\n2. **The \"Theoreticians\" or \"Math Hackers\"**:\n   - This group is more focused on the theoretical foundations of computing and mathematics. They are often involved in developing new algorithms, exploring mathematical proofs, and advancing the theoretical understanding of computation.\n   - Math Hackers are typically interested in the abstract and conceptual aspects of computer science. They tend to value precision, formal methods, and the beauty of mathematical solutions to problems.\"\n\n\nNot saying this is necessarily applies to you, things might also need to click.\nI started programming at 12 by myself and couldn't really get into the more mathematical aspects for years.\nIt was much later at university that I started to enjoy the math side of things and got my PhD.; C++ and Python both have some quirks which can be a bit unforgiving to beginners. Python is dynamically typed and has runtime determined types, so your IDE is probably not going to notice or fix type errors for you, so you'll usually have to fix them at runtime with print statements. C++ has pointers and pointer references which can be quite difficult to read and debug\n\nHave you tried a modern, statically typed, no pointers/garbage collected language? Such as: C#, Dart, Swift, TypeScript, Go, Kotlin. My favorite languages are C#, Dart, and Swift. I've only used a bit of TypeScript but I think it's a bit easier than JavaScript because of type safety. I haven't used Go or Kotlin but have read good things about them.\n\nI've always enjoyed software development, but now that I've used C# and Dart and Swift, I like it even more. If Assembly, C, C++, Java, and Python are closer to Lego, then statically typed modern languages are closer to Duplo - the pieces are chunkier, easier to handle, and the sharp edges have been filed off. You have to remember that many programming languages were created 20 to 40 years ago, when PCs were less powerful, and before many modern improvement in language or compiler design\n\nWhatever language you try, make sure you are using a modern IDE which has syntax highlighting, linting enabled, and type safety checking. You should also try installing an LLM code assistant. Visual Studio Code is free, and you can add GitHub Copilot for $10/month to greatly enhance your experience; Yep, moving from unpaid programming at university to paid programming at work made it much more enjoyable for me. Still it's sometimes a bit boring though.; I failed my 1st year introductory CS class 3x times and my university CS advisor were telling me \"y'know... maybe we simply made a mistake in our admission\"\n  \ngot job offers in the USA for my internship and full-time (new grad) anyway, now I'm probably making 4x if not 5x vs. what that CS advisor in my home country makes; Yep, nearly switched majors in first year but stuck out an internship over the summer and liked it so did the rest of the degree; [removed]; I don't have a job yet, but I recently graduated. I have built up 3 full-stack apps with MERN, PERN and a third that uses TS/next, Django and Postgres. I also have a game I've been working on that has about 40,000 lines of code (wrote a python script that analyses lines written in a folder and all sub folders) in C# and Unity. I had a pretty good time with those and can get lost programming for hours on end, but I couldn't stand the core CS curriculum. I really only enjoy learning stuff if it is directly applicable to building things. Inverting a binary tree or finding cycles in a graph or using C++ for really anything is just not my jam. It's a pretty wide field and there are a lot of things you can do with programming expertise that don't involve the inane bullshit you do in a college class.; I like AS degrees in Computer Programming rather than BAS in Information Systems. I find that BAS courses are too dumbed down like step down from AS courses.; I took one CS class in college. Thought it was too boring. Switched majors to journalism. Graduated. Realized I fucked up. Self taught, and now I'm a principle and love it."

   "Top Comments": "I do great on the interview when I can talk to a person. Code tests kick my ass; I’m a principal engineer with 25 YOE.  I’ve been at the same company for 18 years.  I’d fall on my face in a leet code interview, because I never do that crap in my actual work.; You got promoted really quickly tbh. Sometimes that’s good because it shows you’re capable. The downside is it can cover up a lot of technical deficiencies. When I was changing staff roles I realized that when I was promoted I hadn’t learned eveythung I should have for that role. I was too young to have seen it all. I had to take a step back and learn those things I had realized I didn’t know.\n\nThe other thing is you’re out of practice. It’s hard nowadays, way higher standards than a couple years ago. That’s just the market and you need to take it as reps and learn and it sounds like you are.\n\nTake some interviews at companies you don’t want to work for. Learn from those and how to do it again. When you’re ready jump for those roles you really want and you’ll get through it.; I'm on the job market and a strategy that's been helping me more recently is to ask your friends or (family) network for introductions to people they know whose companies are hiring (nothing groundbreaking here) and get referrals.\n\nI built a chrome extension to help with this search: It cycles through profiles in someone's LinkedIn connections list and looks for jobs at their companies, so you can ask your friends or former coworkers for an introduction. Looking for feedback!\n\n[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/innetwork-job-finder/ipclfaglfigdjcfpnhpafgegpghigcog](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/innetwork-job-finder/ipclfaglfigdjcfpnhpafgegpghigcog); You’re doing normal bro. I blank out all the time. I just keep interviewing until I fit the vibe. Idk, don’t got much advice because I’ve got the same problem. I just keep interviewing. Also drunk rn. Good luck dawg.; It sounds like you're burning all of this on real interviews. Do mock interviews instead. Record yourself, practice your answers, practice your approach and talk tracks as you discuss problems you know how to do.\n\n9 companies where you've got to interview rounds is impressive, but choking that frequently is a problem.  The definition of insanity is repeatedly doing the same thing and expecting a different result.; Yea I still bomb 10 years in. Not a whole fuck of a lot you can do tbh. It's really the luck of the draw. \n\nSome interview's you're gonna knock out of the park. Sometimes you just see the question and go \"lol\". It's really a shitty process.; This sounds like it has nothing to do with your skillset. It sounds like interview anxiety and stress.  Just spend more time practing your interview skills and have a list of things to talk about if possible.; Seriously same situation and I am confused… I interviewed on 2022 and pretty much passed 3/5 interviews(2 offer and 1 conditional). But this time bombed 5/5. I think I am getting better and better each time but the time from one interview to another interview is so much longer.; I've bombed probably a hundred interviews. Every time I start a new job hunt, I will start off interviewing with companies that I know I will never take an offer from and practice with them first. I save the ones I really want for the end and take those all at once in a two week block.; I do fantastic on take home projects, which I find resemble real work more often than algorithmic problems. \n\nI sometimes do well in live coding exercises and sometimes bomb. A lot depends on whether or not the problem type is familiar and also the interviewer.\n\nIn some interviews, I've gotten the solution correct, and either the interviewer didn't understand my solution or had the wrong solution themselves.\n\nI worked for one company where the developers would search for coding problems online about an hour before the interview, print out the solutions for all the developers, and ask the candidates to solve those problems, not understanding the solutions themselves.; in total or my most recent experience\n  \nif latter I think I went something like 7 onsites 0 offers so that's about 42 interviews gone (I define 'interview' as whenever I need to meet someone new, so the typical loop 1x HR -> 1x coding -> onsite: 2x coding 1x system design 1x behavioral I consider that as 6 interviews)\n  \nif the former, probably at least 400+ technical interviews in my lifetime, easily 1000+ if you include HR phone calls too; 0 because I refuse to work for companies that insist on leetcode style interviews being the true measure of a successful engineer.\n\nWill immediately tell the recruiter or HM that I’m no longer interested the moment I catch wind of it.\n\nYMMV; Write down what you’ve done and practice answering the questions you bomb. You’ve got this! Getting the interview is the hardest part.; I’ve bombed a lot of interviews, and I’ve worked at a variety of popular tech companies you’ve 100% heard of.\n\nKeep your head up. Bombing an interview does not decrease your value as a person or engineer. If anything, it will burn those concepts in your mind so you’ll crush that sort of problem the next time around! Interviewing is a numbers game. You’ll get that perfect interview run eventually!; I’ve bombed 6 interviews. 2 at FAANG. One at EA. I’m doing fine working at FAANG adjacent and make 200k + in Canada. I hate Leetcode type of questions. Luckily my current job asked simple question (palindrome) and rest was mostly talking about experience and some easy system design. \n\n8 YOE SDET to DevOps now. I’m a top performer and have got 2 raises already. Been promoted to Principal from Senior. I work 30-35 hours a week but work is challenging and hectic sometimes.; I bombed at least 20 interviews until I landed a job; Whenever I go on the hunt, I always bomb the first few. Just, no matter if the questions are easy, hard, something I know, something I don't, I do terribly. Its something I've just had to grow accustomed to and know that I'll just not do great on my first few sets.; I had started interviewing a month ago. I had bombed 4 so far. I hope there will be light at the end of this tunnel.; Practice if you can. Even just yourself. This sounds like nonsense but honestly, it's just a skill, and skills get better with practice.\n\nGo to your computer, bring up some sample interview questions. Put on a timer, and record yourself answering them. Then go away for a few minutes. Come back and listen to the recording. Does it sound good? Did the right things get said? Be really honest with yourself... identify parts that could be improved and parts that are just fine.\n\nEven doing just a few rounds of that does wonders, skill and confidence wise. Even better if you can get someone to interview with; if the issue is nerves, then doing these mock interviews in front of a person might be a good way to get over it. \n\nBut you can do it. Just need practice, and the confidence that comes along with that."

   "Top Comments": "You can do your part by creating onboarding documentation.\n\nThey will need to figure it out, not you.; You're not really in charge of training your replacement. Your goal during offboarding is to make sure you get as much of the info in your head into written documentation as possible.\n\nHopefully you have onboarding docs already, but lets imagine you didn't. If all you did was setup a zoom meeting with your replacement where you walked them through how to setup their local environment... people forget things, or mishear things. You're setting them up for failure. Even if they remember everything perfectly, now whenever *they* need to train *their* replacement they have to go through the same process. It's not sustainable. You need clear, written documentation.\n\n>so literally the entire codebase is written by me\n\nIs it documented? From how to set it up locally, how to deploy, how to run the test suites, any special business logic, notable hacks, or tech debt? If not, that's the most critical thing to do ASAP. If so, then you simply toss your replacement at the docs, and tell them to come to you with questions.\n\n>10s of thousands of lines of code\n\nIf it makes you feel better, this is a very manageably sized code base. There's legacy code bases out there that are in the *millions*. Even if you didn't write a single bit of documentation, a 5-figure codebase wouldn't be *that* hard to reverse engineer.\n\n>If the code isn’t maintained and eventually improved upon the entire company will be in shambles.\n\nThis isn't your problem.\n\nFor what it's worth, a lot of people when they leave their jobs as the sole / lead dev, they think everything's going to collapse in their absence. I'm guilty of this too. In reality, the company will always survive. It will be a productivity hit, it will push back deadlines by months/years, but they will always eventually get another engineer to reverse engineer your stuff to the point where they become productive again.\n\nIf a single person leaving a company bankrupts it, that's not the fault of the engineer. That's the fault of grossly incompetent management.; Just write good docs, and leave with as much stuff automated as possible, with the least amount of “surprise”.\n\nYou can try to train a replacement, but it’s not your problem how they do. It’s also impossible to get feedback on how well you trained them, since you you are gone, so it’s hard to get good at it.\n\nWhat happens in these situations, is the new dev comes in, and just re writes what they don’t understand. If you spent your time making your code easy to rewrite; that’d be helpful.; I have to commend you for having so much empathy. Pls disregard jaded redditors here. Most people don’t have your early experience and are speaking from a source of pain from the bubble popping. \n\nI would write some good documentation. If your company doesn’t have documentation software, Google Drive will suffice with nice table of contents links. \n\nYou can also offer consulting work at a multiplier of your current hourly, accounting for taxes as well. That way you can still help them out in college while making money and having something awesome on your resume. Consulting as a freshman is super rare and you can leverage this into a top tier internship early on. Maybe you can even start a company off this contract!; [removed]; Least effort way for you is to show the new guy what to do on a daily basic. To learn the code base, that's his job.\n\nSee if you can do the college degree online (no1 cares if you did it online) and work at the same time. Not getting a job these days is much harder than not getting a college degree.; The good news is that you're much more replaceable than you think. The company will survive without you.

Too many lawyers, not enough jobs.  There were paralegals making more than lawyers and lawyers taking paralegal jobs just to pay bills.  Don't think that law (or any field really) is recession proof.\n\n  \nIf you want to be a lawyer that's totally fine.  I'm not trying to say you shouldn't be.  It's just not a guaranteed path forward.; Graduate with your CS degree and try to get an internship or a CS job after you graduate if it doesn't work out after a year of your graduation go into law. Also, you mentioned you're a veteran, so you might be eligible for jobs that require clearance and other CS jobs that are only are available to us US citizens.; For swe- leetcode is all that matters. The technologies are thought on the job. Interviews are the hard part; Litigation support includes querying data, so some of the skills that you have picked up will be useful. And you can specialize in technical aspects, including your experience as a veteran.; Same issues in law with over saturated market. Both infustries have a very bimodalp income distributions with a few making 200k and most making 50k. Also CS isn't typically considered a licensed profession outside of a few very niche careers. \n\nAs for doing projects, find a problem to solve. Anything you want to automate at home? My buddy built a water leak monitoring system with a couple of sensors. It was set up in his laundry room because it had leaked in there before. Now if it ever happens again the system sends him an email. But the neat part is he set up an automatic valve at the houses main that turns off water. I think they communicated over z wave.; I have been in the industry for 8 years and graduated from a good college. They rarely teach you specific technologies, the concepts are more important. A good SWE has a good understanding of data structures, memory management, databases, operating systems…\n\nThese concepts apply everywhere, and you can pretty much learn any language/framework within few months (being expert takes years)\n\nEvery year there are new technologies and others get outdated, it doesn’t matter though because the concepts are the same with some improvements here and there.\n\nCPUs, RAMs, Operating Systems, Networking… are the same since the 1980. Now they are just faster, smaller, new improvements, maybe new concepts but rarely you see something very new.\n\nSo understand the concepts and the technologies will come…; Speaking roughly from a money and career perspective, CS > Law. Law is super over saturated too and you need to go 200k+ in debt to make less than a new grad faang engineer.; Law sounds more boring but Idk.; >\"this degree doesn't particularly feel like it is preparing me to be competitive in the job market and this seems like a train leading to broken tracks.\"\n\nCS degree is/was/never will \"prepare ... competitive in the job market\".\n\nCS degree is simple piece of paper that prove you learned CS basics and practiced CS enough to pass and get the CS degree.  \n\nYou have to do the personal projects, leetcode grind, intern grind, first tech job grind, you have to grind VERY HARD to be \"competitive in the job market\".\n\nTech career is very difficult.  It's not for anyone that simply want to coast on easy money job.; Three years from now, that field is going to be as saturated as CS is now, as everyone piles into it.  You'll be $200,000 in debt only to hit the same wall you are hitting now.  Furthermore, if there are fewer coders, there are fewer patents.  So there will be more patent attorneys competing for fewer jobs.; This is also what I was seeing in terms of opportunity. I felt like this would be both fruitful; as well as, making me very competitive in the market and for law school applications. Whereas with CS, my grades are good and I am a hard-working student, but I absolutely feel like a small fish in a big pond where I am just unsure about how realistic it is to succeed in this field given all of the nuances above + competing with people who have coded since they were 5 years old with no other life obligations or interests outside of CS.; I am working actively on a minor in Philosophy as a sort of passion study that I enjoy and I do find interest in law. I recently correlated my interest in Philosophy to law in a way that made me feel as though I would likely enjoy the process of constructing similar arguments in the context of law. This leads me to believe I could enjoy the practice of law; although, I am a bit more gravitated/interested in criminal law than utilizing the benefit that I could go into patent-law.; Perhaps this is just more so about the state of our economy rather than tech specific. To me it is just the uncertainty and time investment I've put forward that worries me in terms of all of it not being fruitful.; That was 10 years ago; This is what I was largely thinking was my game-plan as well. I also considered what you have proposed in the sense that government/federal work would be ideal for maintaining job security so that isn't at all too bad! This is assuming the federal sector of CS would be enjoyable to work in and or well compensating enough to have as a career of course \\[which I have to look into\\]. \n\nI have just heard things such as \n\n1) If you work in the federal sector for a long time it is hard to transition to traditional for-profit companies CS jobs that civilians do, due to how different the practices are. At least this is what my professor had told me\n\n2) Federal doesn't pay as well \\[albeit, I have no frame of reference to if they're comparing federal work to the pinnacle of tech compensation or the average tech compensation\\].; Generally speaking, how are these interviews \"weighted\" so-to-speak. I assume it's like 70% leetcode/technical skills and 30% soft-skills. I do want to give CS my best shot, but I also want to be ready in case I am just not cutting it in the field. My grades are good, but I am painfully self-aware that it doesn't mean much in terms of industry competency. I may also be having anxiety about what is expected of a junior dev that is unrealistic in terms of a recruiter's expectations.; This is true for new grads but not seniors or even mid level. The languages don’t matter but you’re expected to understand higher level concepts of the job you’re doing; I am totally okay with working on personal projects, but I wonder . . .\n\nWill a recruiter dismiss the projects altogether if they are not relevant to the position?\n\nExample: I create the project your friend made, but I am applying to a game-dev position \\[hypothetically\\]. The recruiter argues I used Java and the position wants me to utilize C# and my program didn't utilize certain algorithms or tools they're looking for. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs for the saturated markets, it feels rather defeating in this economy. I am just super worried about working myself into the ground, degrading my mental health, and having not much to show for it. I am sure many others in this reddit may feel similarly unfortunately."

   "Top Comments": "The best time to start to write your promo doc was 3 years ago.  The second best time is today.\n\nIt's interesting you're still at entry level after 3 years.  Entry level is generally up or out role, at around 2 years mark.\n\nMaybe there's a reason why you still remain at FAANG, while all the tech downturn churn is happening.; Organizational changes and manager changes can cause promos to be delayed, it happens and it sucks. But:\n\n>Admittedly, my promotion being delayed 4 quarters+ has left me feeling frustrated at corporate work and my team and it is bleeding into my work: X sat me down on our 1:1 and told me I've been acting confrontational and that I'm not insisting on keeping high standards which is why he's not putting me up for promo anymore.\n\n>This should not be promotion blocking feedback, it's something you can work on even if you do get promoted. If it was promo blocking, this should have made aware to me well in advance.\n\nI'm quite confused about your thought process here. If your frustration and acting confrontational has only started recently, how could it have been made aware to you well in advance? Especially given you've only been working with the new manager for 3 weeks?\n\nNote that most companies have lagging promos. Meaning, you need to meet ALL of the expectations at the next level for a sustained period of time for the promotion to happen. If you're meeting expectations at the next level in say four out of five areas but lacking in a fifth, that's probably enough to block promo. Especially if that fifth area is interpersonal skills and being pleasant to work with. If you have a reputation of being difficult and are on your manager's bad side, promo isn't going to happen.; >This should not be promotion blocking feedback, it's something you can work on even if you do get promoted. If it was promo blocking, this should have made aware to me well in advance.\n\nYou're out of your mind. I would never promote someone with behavioral issues like that. If he's only been evaluating you for 3 weeks, then he couldn't have let you know way in advance. And in my experience, people who make excuses like that for such behavior are lying and mysteriously always have recurring instances of such behavior that they make various excuses for.\n\n3 is the right option, imo. If you have the skills and experience that you should have, you could probably hop to another FAANG company.\n\nedit: You know he's new and evaluating you closely for promotion for a few weeks, and you \\*still\\* can't behave well? Wow.; This is suspicious but I don’t have enough information to make an assessment. Just like your new manager.; > managers recency bias\n\nNah your shit attitude and lack of initiative is what’s caused this, even now you’re making excuses by putting blame on others.; Original manager should never have promised you anything. You should know better as well.; Should have left a year ago. But 3 years entry level is a huge red flag you might need to do some self reflection and figure out the root cause because even with bad management that's pretty unusual. If it really is their fault you should have been gone.; this is why you don't work at Amazon; You learned a few things:\n\n* how easy is to shoot yourself in the foot (\"has left me feeling frustrated at corporate work and my team and it is bleeding into my work\")\n* sometimes things are outside your control (your manager left, you got a new manager)\n\nIn your situation the right thing to do is to grow up: learn that you can't always get what you want, and temper tantrums don't help; the right move in that situation is to move on.\n\nFind another team. If it doesn't work, find another company.; [removed]; Why didn’t u start 3 years ago; What is recency bias; [removed]; Isn’t entry-level to entry-level +1 automatic after a year or so?; Okay, i recommend start writing your work summary (this is not promo doc, write everything you've done; dm if you need format/details because ik which company asks for \"insisting on high standards\" lol). As it was pointed out by someone in the comments that this should have started 3yrs back only. Start collecting your artifacts and polish your design docs, etc. Go to your manager and ask for feedback as to what they think is lacking in the doc rn. What datapoints are missing and tell them that you need their support to complete it. I'm sure they will give you something to complete those datapoints and take you to promo next quarter. However, if they still don't help then obviously it's a big sign to switch things up.; [removed]; Same thing happened with me and I wrote the doc myself and shared with the EM. Now I am waiting for him to review and submit it. Convincing is a bit hard part though; I wouldn't call it recency bias, someone at X level will show X level characteristics in everything they do. If for the past 3 weeks you've been showing junior level skills then you're a junior engineer.; Your current boss just doesn’t know what is going on and is using an excuse to block your promotion. Granted you being frustrated and “confrontational” also doesn’t help. This was me 2 years ago and I left. We had too many re-orgs and new bosses can’t fight for you in a promotion. We only had 1 promotion cycle per year too.; 3. 3 all fucking day. Fuck these comments saying YOU have to put in more work to get your argument across when you got fucked over by your old manager.

It's too general and is the opposite of what a masters is supposed to do which is narrow your focus.\n\nAt the end of the day, no one is going to hire you just because you got some random degree from Cornell. That's why we have technical interviews. Mba from Penn state may not be as good as something from a top 5 but it's still better than nothing. Plus Penn state is not some random unknown school.; Anything from Cornell is better than anything from XYZ state; Anything with engineering in it is better than a business degree and will hold more weight.; I have a few years worth of professional coding experience and a degree in computer science. I do enjoy software engineering but I really can’t see myself doing it for another ten years which is why I’m thinking about other degree types.; So that’s what I was thinking - maybe the name is more important than the degree type? I don’t really want to do anything systems engineering career-wise though; Is that necessarily true though? I mean, if you plan on staying in an engineering related role for the rest of your career then maybe?; I would go for the Cornell name then. I think the requirements to make it as an exec are really just that and schmoozing with the right people. It's not like you need an MBA to be a manager or PM. Haven't you worked with a few of them already? Did they seem to have arcane knowledge, or were they just spreadsheet jockeys? Did they seem to do anything that a competent retail manager couldn't do?; Probably if you want to be an executive.

Assume 2-3 yoe in a very, very, VERY poopy tech stack and no real “engineering”. Graduating with masters as well with a focus on systems/ML (stuff like high performance computing, cloud/distributed and software analysis with LLVM). How do I even effectively market myself?

That comes with real experience, not just YOE. Keep doing larger projects and it'll happen. Don't stay at one company if you don't get to do larger things.\n\n>Do people just pretend like they know what they are doing?\n\nHoly Jesus, man. At every level of a company most people are just assuming they know how to handle things and then attributing all success to their own skill and intelligence and all bad results to something other than their own inexperience or incompetence.; \"ignoring\" the specific case and answering what I do think is the spirit of the question.\n\nYou half \"fall\" into specialist roles by some  lucky coincidence as well as taking some initiative when you can to nudge your career that way.

You probably won't have a tone of input the first few times, but you'll start to get a feel for how things are done and hopefully start doing it yourself.\n\nI've found that one of the best ways to progress in your career is to express a desire to skill up.

So what? How much does he weight and how much does he bench?; Startups are not for you, I don't recommend joining one.\n\n10 years for mid level roles seems weird, that's a red flag and not a legitimate job posting.\n\nYou get this experience by working on projects, learning from your experiences, and being willing to step up when there's a need for it, which there is often.

   "Top Comments": "So I graduated WGU back at the end of 2023 and I went for the CS degree. I went for the CS degree because even though I like programming and software engineering as a field, I’m also open to other roles in the future should my career open up to new roles that I didn’t have knowledge of before. \n\nCS is considered the “gold standard” and very universal. The SWE degree is definitely more geared to JUST SWE, so if you know for a fact that’s what you want to do then by all means go for it. But if you aren’t sure or are more open to other roles then probably the CS degree is more your speed. Yes there’s more math in the CS degree and more theory classes like Operating Systems and Discrete Math, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nI posted a more in depth thread about my journey below. I went to WGU when I was 29 also, so you got this! \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/s/7plPWtklW1; They're the exact same thing, although idk if schools now are requiring AI as part of CS. However it's not too different, and from my experience both required the same math prerequisites (surprisingly I reaaaaly enjoyed calculus with the professor I had years ago! I was very anxious cause I had heard calculus is hard but it was probably my favorite math subject in a while somehow)\n\nAnyways I think you should just select CS, since CS is more linked with AI now than SWE and thus you might have more doors open up than the latter, but as I said there's really barely any difference honestly (there was like 2 or 3 classes that were different at most for me a couple years ago)\n\nAt the end of the day, you make of it what you will. Most students just want to finish their assignments and get the A, so they cheat then end up with poor programming skills to pass interviews. Nowadays I think every company is requiring a coding assessment just like FAANG did for years. So if you read a lot of code (this is what helped me really understand programming) and try solving problems on your own, you should have no issues\n\nIf you do pursue either degrees, I recommend taking AI courses as a concentration since a lot of companies now look for those keywords like LLMs, etc\n\nIf you need more clarification or have other questions lmk 😊; Software Eng may be better if you’re interested in Embedded, otherwise just do CS. I did Software Eng. it’s just more stressful for no reason (Eng courses had a dumb rule where you had to pass both labs and theory to pass the course etc).

I’m hoping this path would be beneficial for both my short-term and long-term goals.\n\nHow the fuck does that logic track? Why not get the CS degree now? What goals do you think the MS would help with?\n\n>I’d love to aim for a job at a FAANG company. Would a CS degree be better for this?\n\nPossibly. But if you're willing to put in the work, you can do it with either one.\n\n>I've spent hours reading everyone's anecdotes and it's just led to more uncertainty.\n\nSo asking for more of the same here will remove the uncertainty? I want whatever you've been smoking.; I thought they were the same degree. Where they aren’t, you want the one that makes you take more math. Recruiters who recruit at your university every year will know the difference.\n\nYou say FAANG so you want to move to California or Seattle then get laid off.

Up to you to delay your entry in the workforce by 2 years to get that plus box checked on 10% of jobs. If you do want those more research oriented jobs then makes sense.\n\nIf your in-major isn’t at least 3.0, you won’t be admitted to grad school.

   "Top Comments": ">I don’t see how this can be considered bad when they have fired people and kicked them out of the system the same day.\n\nThat's how firing for cause works even without a bad manager.\n\nResigning to HR is an option if you don't believe you can resign to your manager in a professional way. If you're given something to sign on the way out, you have no obligation to sign it.; You just slip out the back, Jack\n\nMake a new plan, Stan\n\nYou don't need to be coy, Roy\n\nJust get yourself free\n\nHop on the bus, Gus\n\nYou don't need to discuss much\n\nJust drop off the key, Lee\n\nAnd get yourself free; >and saying I will ship back my work equipment to the company address ?\n\nDon't just blindly ship it. With your notice of resignation, ask for instructions on how to return the equipment. Most companies that are more than a handful of people have a defined process to follow. My employer has a service they use which ships out a pre-labeled box/boxes for you to pack everything into and then you just drop it off at the UPS or FedEx store (or some other place that accepts pre-labeled packages for shipping).; In any case I'd be more concerned for the coworkers who will have to pick things up Monday morning. They'll be the ones you'll be networking with for future jobs and what not.\n\nDocument things. Bring them in to meetings or share your designs to subtly get them more or less up to speed on whatever you're doing. Put your documentation in an easy to find place. Pretend you're planning on a vacation or something.\n\nIt sounds like you won't be able to do a full handover, but you can at least send a farewell email with links to everything so when your boss comes in on Monday in a foul mood yelling at them to pick up your projects they at least won't be cursing you for doing a shit job.; Resign without notice. Companies can drop you without notice too so the whole 2 week notice thing is a good-faith effort if you felt respected by the company you are leaving.\n\n\nJust connect with some of your employees personally, even if it's just a direct message or email. Explain why you are doing it. Hopefully they will at least appreciate you reaching out. You never know if you will want these people to vouch for you in future job searches.; - Find another gig  \n- Get an offer signed  \n- Tell your new employer you're leaving your old job for this, but only after the offer is signed  \n- When your offer is signed, immediately email your boss and HR you will be leaving on so and so date.   \n  \nBe nice, say nice things, get references, fake niceness if you need to. You want to leave like an angel, not a devil.; Depends if you don't want to keep any connections from your previous place just pull the trigger; Find a new job and put your 2 weeks notice in. Start your new job and move on.; It's mostly about how you want to be perceived by the people you leave behind. Even if there are no overt consequences now, you never know who will be on a future hiring panel and remember your story without any of the context you feel validated your actions.\n\nEdit after OP's edit about a small team: Obviously look out for yourself, but if you have the capacity to offer your peers a smooth transition, even a week's notice, it would be ideal.; Hey guys,\nI was on bench for the last few months and was planning to resign for higher studies.Last day I got a project alinment mail from a senior manager and she asked me to connect back.I'm not at all interested to work there.So can I put a resignation and then connect with her and say that I did put my resignation and not interested to work on project as Im going for my higher studies in July.As a fresher I'm almost worried about the part that whether they might take any action for rejecting the project.As a fresher I'm very much concerned about their action if I put notice on the coming working day; The way you quit represents who you are. You can still quit in a professional manner even if you think some people around you aren't professional.; just make sure you follow the resignation procedures in your contact, some require you to notify a month before leaving, some require you to notify certain people.\n\ngood job quiting tho 👍🏻 I'm 1 month into the new job and it's so much fun!; Why would you do that?\n\nIf you can, give your standard 2 weeks notice; it's the professional thing to do. If not ... Meh, do as you have to ;)\n\nI can tell you,  I would probably not recommend any coworker who left without notice. The chances of something like this hurting you are small, but ... Why do it?; [removed]; [removed]; https://youtu.be/9A4UGtM4hDQ?si=qE-A90vJwausrDjP; Like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2iErckaIl8&; Personally, I would take some of your dignity back and quit in an unprofessional way. Disincentivize some of the toxic behavior you've been subjected to.; This is the perfect time to quit without notice.  You can also expect that if you give notice they might just fire you on the spot, so I’d definitely quit without notice the day before I started somewhere else; OP, look after yourself. Get out. Resign via email to HR. Just do it.\n\nA very successful mentor of mine once advised me to not react emotionally to a situation at work that had upset me. When I asked her what she did in a similar situation, she said the opposite. She reacted emotionally, threatened to resign, and got her way.\n\nSo what I'm saying is, react emotionally. Go with your gut. Look after yourself."

I’m not saying you can’t do the job without an advanced degree; I’m saying, that’s one of the things US recruiters are looking for. It especially hurts your chances with US recruiters that your undergraduate degree is from your country. I have a friend who, even with a degree from a top uni in Switzerland, struggled to get callbacks for US jobs.; Your situation is golden I not understand why you want to move now as US is now on the cycle of outsourcing to APAC till that spaghetti code star generating headaches and break production.\n\nIf I were you I would rather continue to save money and even if you want to start a family you can still save 50% of the salary; >Is applying directly just not working for someone wishing to immigrate, even if they have visa?\n  \n>I can legally work in UK/Switzerland, but don't have an US visa.\n  \nso you have a visa or you don't have a visa? your title says yes but your description says no\n  \nand if yes, which visa is it?\n  \nif not, what is the visa class you're seeking?

Every year, many PhDs graduate from top institutions in the US and still can't find anyone willing to sponsor their visa. The tech market in the US right now is terrible, and there's just too much talent. Sponsoring overseas visas is very troublesome and uncertain (due to the lottery), so no company is willing to do that.\n\nIf you really want to come to the US, your best bet is to apply to American companies' branches in the EU (like Poland) and seek to be transferred to the US. If you're truly exceptional, I'm sure you'll stand out in the workplace and be transferred to the US.; >But i'm starting to get really frustrated being rejected from so many average companies, when my skills are above their requirements.\n\nThis is pretty much everyone right now. The tech job market is bad. The applicant to jobs ratio is very high, which favors employers, and is harder on job seekers.\n\nYou aren't getting the jobs you want, so you are speculating as to the reason.

   "Top Comments": "i heard welding is the next big thing; It doesn't hurt to learn some backend as a frontend developer, otherwise how are you going to deploy your project?; I would say you should learn at least a little backend. Get comfortable with how Node.js works. Sometimes the problem isn't with the code, but with the build or deployment toolchain. Being able to figure that out pretty effectively is something that will be expected. \n\nAs for what to study, git is always good. Git is really important and you need to know it. \"Hosting\" doesn't really mean the same thing it used to. Now it can be something like \"deploying to Vercel\" or \"setting up a CDN\" or \"running a Node.js server on your own instance somewhere\" and a lot of things in between. So understanding at a fundamental level how your app runs is important. Maybe it is just serving up static files. That's easy. Maybe there is some server-side rendering going on if you are using a framework like Next.js. That's a little more complicated. Basically learn the different flavors of execution environment your code can run in. I know it is easy to think \"frontend means it will only run in the browser\" but nowadays that isn't always the case.\n\nUI/UX is important if you insist on being a one-person operation, but in a lot of real world situations  you will be implementing something someone else designed. It is important to know how to build those experiences in code, but actually designing them yourself is somewhat tangential to what I would expect a \"frontend developer\" to typically do.\n\nIf you are concerned about frameworks, learn React.js. It has a big chunk of market share, and several other popular frameworks are inspired by it. A lot of bigger, more full-featured frontend frameworks also use React as the foundation. Can't go wrong knowing it.; LMFAO"

There might be more resources for learning it than any other programming language today.\n\nA company will always place you according to where they need you, not where you want to be. One way that COBOL orgs bring in young developers is by teasing them about \"opportunities\" with other technology in the same company.\n\nIf you don't want COBOL jobs, I'd suggest removing all direct mentions of COBOL and anything IBM from your resume, and leaning on the Java and .NET experience that you have, more than taking up another language.; COBOL, that's interesting. Outdated is an understatement. It's the bane of existence of health insurance with IBM emulated mainframes and TSYS for the banking industry. Too expensive to move off.\n\nCS is rough to break into right now but you have actual work experience and COBOL knowledge in those two industries will be noticed and appreciated, even in mainstream CS work.\n\nMainstream CS, I'd say pick one of C#, Java, Go aka Golang, or Python. Python is the easiest but more jobs in C# and Java. Go jobs tend to let you learn it while there if you already know C#, Java or Python.\n\nIf you don't have a CS or engineering degree, which is what I think you're saying, still will be difficult to get hired doing anything besides COBOL.; COBOL has very high job security, you could try finding another job with that. AI is on an investor driven boom right now and we don't know how long it will last.; Sounds like you're burned out. Take a break.

I'm considering applying for entry-level positions or looking for a company that accepts bootcamp graduates.

   "Title": "How to find a lot of job postings for new grads?",
   "Top Comments": "Right now, many companies aren't hiring at pre-pandemic \"normal\" levels yet. In general, entry level roles aren't in demand unless they're subsidized a bit (i.e. internship programs or WITCH companies). So this is going to be a challenging year to launch new careers.\n\n\nYou will need to keep an eye on job boards like a hawk to catch the intern, junior, and new-grad postings. Many of them will be filtering more selectively than usual, so you'll also be less likely to pass initial screening to an interview.\n\n\nPopular job boards have more postings, but also *much* more competition. Conversely, small, local boards tend to have very limited competition even if the postings aren't as desirable. Also be aware that some locations and *especially* remote positions can be extremely competitive. Meanwhile if you find a startup in the middle of nowhere it might be practically a certainty they'll interview and offer -- but that can be a risky way to gain your initial experience.; This GitHub repository is updated regularly with new new grad job postings. Check it daily and apply to any new positions that are added. [https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/New-Grad-Positions](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/New-Grad-Positions)\n\nKeep looking on LinkedIn and Indeed. Don't use the experience level filters but instead craft your search queries with keywords like \"entry level\", \"new grad\", and \"college grad\". \n\nAlso, be open to relocation. Once you've worked for a few years and have experience, you can always move back to your hometown (or wherever else you want to be). Now is not the time to be picky. Apply to jobs all over the nation. \n\nFinally, network. If your parents, siblings, and friends have openings at their company - or know someone else that does - they could refer you. Referrals could help expedite the interview process and get your resume on top of the pile. Ask your parents, relatives, friends, literally anyone you know if you could send your resume to them and if they could pass it on to their network. My dentist has two adult children who interned/worked at many companies and she was able to give me the contact information of the hiring managers at some of those companies. \n\nIf you live near your college and they still have career fairs, try attending as an alumnus. Talk to recruiters in person and make a good impression.; If you only have 3 months of savings you need to get employed right now. Even during the good times this was too short of a runway.; “lot of times the built-in search and filter functions don't actually help me find what I need.”\n“A lot of the boards that have worked better for me don't have a high volume of positions, and vice versa”\n\nWhat filters are you looking for? And what job boards worked better but didn’t have lots of positions?\nI’m working on a job board (6j dot gg) that has 40k tech jobs and AI-powered filters like YoE, seniority level, tech stack, etc. I made it because I also wasn’t satisfied with existing filters on job sites. ; >but I haven't been able to find much because my classes were pretty demanding and my mental health/personal circumstances were bad\n\nYou didn't have an internship during your studies. This puts you way behind the rest of the competition unfortunately.\n\n>I've applied for a little under 50 in the last few months\n\nUnder 50 in the last few months is basically nothing. You should be doing something like 50 a day.\n\nPost your resume.; Im a new grad myself, but my plan is to physically show up to places and ask if their IT department has any job openings. Such as a local hospital. Though if you do this for an actual CS position, if you even could, this might even be a detriment; this is just my plan for a temporary IT gig\n\nI too didnt do an internship, so I'll just make up for it with some banger projects and maybe get in some IT work while searching for my first CS position.\n\nMy tip is to try and apply directly to company websites. A lot of places have openings that you won't find on boards like linkedin. Like the local hospital from above, they had 2 IT positions not posted on LinkedIn and only on their website.\n\nSo if youre looking local, maybe try what Ill do and open google maps and look for companies in the local area that might need you. If youre looking on job boards, then it seems the best track is basically what everyone is already doing and just looking basically hourly for any new positions in the area you wanna go to pop up and applying almost immediately.\n\nGood luck to us both; >Under 50 in the last few months is basically nothing. You should be doing something like 50 a day.\n\nThat's exactly what I'm asking for help with.\n\nI already know I'm behind, and I've already gotten help (including resume reviews) several times from my university career counselor. I don't want to post too much identifying information on my Reddit account, but I graduated with a 3.7 at a good school, a strong recent technical project (my GitHub is linked on there), and some out-of-industry work experience. My response rate is about on-par with what I see other people getting so far, the issue is actually digging up that many postings.\n\nI know I SHOULD be doing a lot more than I have - and I'm prepared to sink time and energy into it - I'm just struggling with how. I'm trying to pick up the pace, but I don't know where to consistently find anywhere close to 50 new postings every day.; have you tried applying through a recruiter ? I was a sub contractor, then contractor then full employee and i was in the same condition where i cudnt even get to an interview on my own; Go outside and try to convince people in real life to give you a chance"

   "Top Comments": "In this market it'll be pretty tough to secure a fully remote job, which many people would want. Probably best to stick it out with this current role until you can add good resume bullets.; There is nothing specific you need to do to prepare for it beyond just building technical and interview skills so that you're in a position to get offers from remote companies.; I would say spend enough time in your in-person job to get really comfortable with what you are doing. At the beginning of your career, you don't really know what you don't know. Being around other engineers all day will give you a good idea of what you really know and where your knowledge gaps are.\n\nOne challenge with working remote is that when you hit a roadblock you don't always have someone immediately available to unblock you. I had one engineer who interviewed really well and looked great on paper, but a month into the job he still hadn't figured out how to fully set up his local environment. Being able to self-motivate and work through blockers is more valuable and crucial as a remote employee. If you are brand new to the field it really helps to get comfortable with all of the tools and workflows in a place where you have people who can help support you as you get on your feet.\n\nThat being said, if you find after six months that you understand everything and you would feel comfortable getting set up more or less on your own, you might as well start looking for remote work."

   "Title": "Is a linguistics degree overkill for NLP jobs?",
   "Top Comments": "I feel like this would be a better question for r/machinelearning\n\nThat said, would a linguistics degree involve any machine learning at all? Because it's my understanding that modern NLP embeds words meanings as n-dimensional vectors. Not as anything recognizable by a human.; It’s more irrelevant. There was once an NLP researcher at IBM who said “Every time I fire a linguist the performance of the system goes up.”; Linguistic courses are mostly completely useless for NLP. Just take the NLP classes in your university, or take all the ML classes and follow a professor.; Linguistics is not used in LLM research or practice. Effectively all NLP today is LLMs, so...\n\n\n\nOlder NLP papers (like pre deep learning takeover) were sometimes linguistics heavy, but ML knowledge is what is actually useful now.\n\n\nA CS major + Statistics double (or stats minor) would be much more useful.\n\n\nI recommend picking up any linguistics on the side as an intellectual curiosity, but don't expect to use it \"on the job.\"; Yeah it’s overkill. Working with LLMs in industry as a data scientist. Employers mainly want phd with focus on NLP. That’ll probably fade away soon enough to bring on just developers who are good at design and working with LLMs. How they filter that, IMO, should be projects and track record, because I’ve seen data science phds have 0 relevancy to this skillset.; My brother who works at Duolingo did a BS in CS and PhD in computational linguistics. The latter was more about bayesian models than it was about linguistics per se.; \n\nPall; 🤣"

   "Title": "Backend vs. Frontend in Modern Web Applications: Where Does the business logic reside?",
   "Top Comments": "It depends, and many of your intuitions are correct. The decision to put logic on the client vs. the server is an architectural decision and ultimately the best choice depends on the balance of tradeoffs that you're looking for.\n\nSome pros of logic on client:\n\n* Better responsiveness\n* More tolerant to slow networks and network failure\n* Cheaper to run since you're offloading computation to people's devices\n* Can better protect user's privacy (not all data needs to be sent to the server)\n\nSome pros of logic on server:\n\n* Can perform heavier computations\n* Able to hide business logic, better for security and protecting your algorithms\n* Keeps client application simple and small enough to run well on low-end devices\n\nSometimes, the same application can be implemented in different ways. For example, the [Facebook Lite](https://engineering.fb.com/2016/03/09/android/how-we-built-facebook-lite-for-every-android-phone-and-network/) app offloads a lot more processing to the server than the regular app does, in order to have the app size be very small and able to run on the cheapest phones.; A HTTP request actually has many tools to use and your basic GET request.\n\nGoogle Docs for example uses realtime API that basically acts similar to a memory stream where the browser subscribes to a get response and is constantly reading new data provided by the backend using the same request.\n\n[Build collaborative apps with Google Drive Realtime API - Google Developers Blog (googleblog.com)](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/build-collaborative-apps-with-google-drive-realtime-api/); Ahh. Thanks a lot for this! So even something as trivial and non collaborative as spell checks/suggestions are handled by this constant stream?; I'm not 100% sure on the spell check stuff. But the constant stream of collaboration data when you work on the same document with other collaborators is handled this way.\n\nThere are other technologies such as websockets that also allow constant real time information streaming.\n\nIt's also not totally uncommon to just make a bunch of HTTP requests if the data you're expecting is small enough. I've seen this implemented for progress bars. Where the response is basically just a small int to give the progress value. So it's no big deal to make a request several times a second."

   "Top Comments": "With Android \"doing things the hard way\" can have a lot of meanings, and especially with Compose, can mean just doing them wrong with regard to UI stability. Avoiding the easy way to better appreciate it can be a good strategy, as long as you make sure to learn it after all.; I wish I was disciplined enough to follow my own advice, but, list a few core concept programs/paradigms and write each from easiest to hardest in the new language.\n\nE.g.\n\n1. Hello World\n\n2. fizzbuzz\n\n3. Basic text based deterministic RPG\n\n4. A GUI clock with alarm\n\n5. A GUI calculator\n\n6. A GUI survey that stores to a database or a todo list\n\n7. Elevator simulator with GUI\n\nETC; One thing that always helped me was to work on the same problems in different languages. I recommend something like Advent of Code or exercism.org. You can also leetcode problems if that is your thing. Personally, I think Advent of Code is more fun and you can get on reddit and compare your solutions with others to learn about efficient implementations in different paradigms.\n\nBasically I will take a set of problems and first solve it in a language that I am really comfortable with. Then go through and try to figure out how to solve the same problems in the language I am trying to learn. If the language paradigm is similar the solutions might be similar. If they are drastically different (Java vs. Elixir, for a contrived example) the solutions might blow your mind. Either way you learn something valuable and you walk away understanding the language a lot better than if you had only done tutorials for that language.; Always be coding...; Thank you, and I definitely agree. This has been the current approach where I'll learn of a concept, try to implement it, read the documents and stack when I fail, and repeat until I decide look up a solution on that specific thing to learn it. It's a guaranteed appreciation during this process too.; I like this, I'll give it a shot.; That wasn't really the question...I could always be coding, but that means nothing if i burn out over hours of not doing things right.

Simply counter with your terms.  Unless your current offer is $1Million, the company will refuse +$100K counter.  The company may consider full remote counter, if you're senior+ level candidate.; Well them hiring 3 months in this market only means they are not in the hurry to give better compensation.; yeah $110k base increase is too far away to be realistic. In fairness, as i’ve started interviewing around, I realized that I can get comparable numbers just staying in my location. i really like what the role and their company and so the only thing that’d make sense for me is to ask not to relocate even though going in I knew they were looking for hybrid arrangement. Just wanna get your take how I’d bring that up to the HM and the recruiter?; I've seen companies ok $100K signing bonus, mainly to cover some losses from previous company grants and bonuses.\n\nI've not seen companies ok +100K base salary increase.; yes it’s staff+ role. How do you suggest bringing up the full remote counter?; you got a point; I am not Staff+ but have you asked about being mainly remote and offering to fly in - say a few days a month - for a leadership sync. Most Staff+ engineers I worked with did this. I'd see them for at most 4 days out of 20.; thats an idea. i’d ask flying in a week every quarter if they’d cover that cost. thanks for the suggestion."

   "Title": "Experienced but no education; advice for getting into AI?",
   "Top Comments": "Not really sure what you mean by \"foot in the door\". Foot in thy door would be having family members with connections,  a mentor who worked in the field,  or a job at a company that was starting an AI division.   \n\n\nIm not trying to be harsh,  but,  well, no one really cares what you study on your own time. But because it's not valuable, but because it can't be verified.   \n\n\nThat's why degrees, work experience, and portfolio projects have weight. They can be verified.   Everything you've discussed can't be verified by a hiring manager,  so they can't afford to give it weight.  How would they know the difference between you and someone lying.   \n\n\nYou have to look at your claims and qualifications from the perspective of a hiring manager who is lied constantly by candidates.  Another bit of advice: ideas are worth as much as the effort into making them reality. EVERYONE has good ideas,  and if you enter this field you will find you are bombarded with them by family and friends. \n\n\nYou may be brilliant, curious, and hard working.  But here's the thing: so it's the competition. Many of them are just as brilliant, Curtis, and hard working.  AND they have degrees,  work experience, or impressive personal projects. \n\n\nThe market fluctuates every decade or so. Sometimes it's easy to get into with basic knowledge and gumption.  Other times it's extremely competative and you need either a lot of luck or a very competative resume to break in.  A couple of years ago it was the former.  Currently it's the latter. \n\n\nI would not bet on the market being easy to break into through personal study within the next 5 years. LOTS of senior people with degrees and impressive resumes have been laid off in the past two years. \n\n\nAs for degrees,  CS bachelor's is the gold standard. It teaches important foundational skills for mathematics and algorithms that are very helpful in AI. Mathematics is another good route. \n\n\nYou plan of linguistics is certainly possible,  but would be an uphill battle. By the time you get into a masters or PhD program almost EVERYONE is smart and hard working and the vast majority STILL have a hard time. \n\n\nAre you sure you want to be teaching yourself fundamentals of cs and data theory WHILE also trying to study graduate level topics?  \n\n\nAgain, not saying it's impossible.  But statistically very few people can do it. You need to have a very clear view of your strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\nBest of luck.; >I want to get into AI because it is fascinating\n\nSo does everybody else. Everybody wants to get into AI right now. And partially as a result, AI unfortunately suffers a bit from qualification inflation. Even for non-research positions, you will be competing with 5-20% PhDs,  30-50% master's. If you want to do NLP, a linguistics degree with a focus on computational linguistics is not a bad idea. I've met people with linguistics degrees in the field and a lot of the advanced NLP stuff were developed by researchers in a linguistics dept.; TL; DR - try applying to MLE rolls at early stage start ups, or Data Engineering roles with the plan to pivot in a few years. If you're serious about research, prepare to spend the next 10 years in school - you'll need a BS in CS from a top university + a few ML conference papers to get a decent ML PhD program. Either way, don't expect much without years of effort.\n\n\n\nA few points. \n\n\n1. No one working on AI/LLMs cares about linguistics. Effectively no one in the field has any experience (the most common \"standard\" backgrounds are CS and Statistics, while the most common \"tertiary\" backgrounds are Physics and Neuroscience). ML is what people care about. Self studying linguistics will help you gain context for NLP, but don't expect anyone in the field to give you a job for it. Do it for your own curiosity. \n2. UMGC is not reputable. UMD is very reputable. They are not the same.  \n3. Everyone wants into AI right now. And there's a lot of laid off FAANG people floating around. Your chances are not great at the moment.  \n4. Your best bet is to apply, shot in the dark, for MLE jobs at small start ups. Unicorns and big companies will be picky. Most want minimum masters, if not PhD. (You absolutely can get in with just a BS -- *IF* you have prior experience, but you do not).  \n5. While you're doing that, try applying for data engineering jobs. You can try pivoting from DE to MLE in a year or two.  \n6. Don't get ahead of yourself on this PhD thing. You'll need a bachelor's first (in CS, ideally with some Math and or Statistics on the side), and if you want a PhD in ML it's probably gonna have to be from CMU, MIT, Stanford, or equivalent with experience in a top lab and at least 1 or 2 conference papers. The ML PhD application scene is a nightmare right now since everyone wants in. \n7. Your ideas, while probably interesting, are almost certainly not something you could write a PhD thesis on. Also, academic ML research isn't about pushing the bounds of knowledge, it's about making small tweaks to some other folks' paper so you can keep publishing at conferences to keep the grant money flowing. If you want to see what ML research is like, go trawl Arxiv for a few weeks.; Just look for LLM related jobs. Lots of companies are investing a lot in it right now.\n\nYou'll have to go to a company specifically investing in LLMs, but right now there's more of a desire to use the tech, then there are people with experience using generative AI.\n\nAt least that's how I ended up doing LLM work. Got hired at big tech, joined a team, and the biggest problem I could immediately find was an LLM application project.; The University of Maryland (specifically University of Maryland at College Park - UMCP) is different than UMGC. UMCP is the top state school in Maryland. UMGC is like a night school that happens to also be located in College Park.\n\nThe computer science program at UMCP is ranked 17th in the nation. While UMGC is ranked 85th in the nation. That does not mean you are doomed if you go to UMGC. Just that your school and program does not have as much prestige.\n\nIf you do go to UMGC, and you ace your classes, I think you would probably be fine. The instructors there are hit or miss. Some of the coursework is also hit or miss. One convenient thing about UMGC is that I think you can do the whole degree remotely. That is also a drawback if you are trying to make networking connections there.; Look at job advertisements for the AI-related jobs you would like to work in. Note the qualifications they ask for. Get those.\n\nBeware the Dunning-Kruger effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger\\_effect). AI is a field that requires specialized knowledge in the form of formal study and research.; Was your main point in the second paragraph that I shouldn't be as confident as I am that I have my \"foot in the door\"? Just want to be sure I interrupted that right.; …interrupted? You mean interpreted? Yes, it sounds like you may be experiencing the Dunning Kruger effect.; I understood all of the MIT AI course (6.034) pretty well, doesn't that count for something?; Well… did you take the exams and pass the class?\n\nI mean the reason why we have these evaluations is because every poor student will make the same claim. \n\nOk look, as someone who learned how to code years before college then who actually went to college and etc etc… the primary weakness I see in self taught people is lack of rigor and gaps in their knowledge/skills in areas that aren’t of interest to them. Frankly this tends to be math for many people. \n\nNow, what does it mean to “getting into AI”? If you wanna slap a llm on something and sell it, sure I guess anyone can do that shit now. \n\nIf you mean substantively contribute to the state of the art, my guess is you have a ton of linear algebra to learn. A lot of the serious next gen stuff is basically being done in academic and corporate research labs. Tend to be heavy on getting degrees. \n\nIn any case, if you’re as smart as you claim, a college degree should be easy. The best thing about college is the insane flexibility one can get. Between electives and flexible day to day schedule, it was amazing."

That part sounds dumb. I would leave immediately.; From a legal standpoint, you're fine since employment is at-will. \n\nI would suggest you focus more on maintaining the relationship with your friend. Be transparent with him, and make your stance clear.; Feels like there is more to the story than two guys going out for drinks and getting overheard by management.  Unless you're getting drinks in the break room, that seems implausible.; I find it hard to believe someone in management just happened to overhear this and you got a PIP. The real story is that they had somebody watching you to find an excuse to PIP you. Most likely budget cuts coming up and they don't want to payout severance.; No one gets on pip for an inocuos comment. I’m not sure if you are telling the full story on purpose or are unaware of what’s going on.\n\nWhat did you manager say? Why exactly are you on pip? Did they catch you using a mouse jiggler? \n\nRegardless, take the new offer, give your two weeks but just do the minimal effort.; I'd take the new job. Call your friend first, and let him know you feel screwed over. He gets it. His honest criticism was taken the wrong way by a management team neither of you can ever trust again.\n\nOne more thing: it could be that the PIP is targeting specifically at \"availability on Fridays\", and that being the only issue, you have a decent chance of getting out of it. I'd at least talk to the manager who put you on a PIP and ask if the conversation contributed to it, and how it went down. Present them with the facts, and give them a chance to defend it. If they can't explain how an overheard (and potentially misheard) comment leads to a PIP, that's all you need to know.; I always choose friendship over an employer. Burning an employer is really fun, but not at the expense of throwing away a friendship. I would talk to your friend and see if it screws him if you walk out. \n\nMy best friend walked out of a job that he and I were the sole devs at. Before he quit, he called me and told me he was walking out. I said “I am sorry that I brought you here. These people lost their minds in the last month, and I do not blame you one bit for walking. We should go out to lunch to celebrate your new job this week.”; Isn’t this the dream scenario? You get pip’ed and a decent severance package while starting your new job. I’ve always wanted to double dip like this.; Missing the critical info - how did it get heard to the management if there were only the two of you?; Make sure you have the other offer in writing and have signed everything before giving any notice or lack thereof and quitting.; Jesus. If this isn't parody or sarcasm, which I highly doubt because no one would be put on a PIP for that, then do the PIP and get laid off. More likely than not you'll be given a handsome payout to agree to not come sue the company for wrongful termination. \n\nI have to suggest that you are being put on a PIP for a different reason though and those reasons would need to be outlined in your plan in order to address how to improve.\n\nAlthough, in this case, if what you say is true, maybe sue for wrongful termination, because that's simply the case. If you don't want the legal headache though, just finish your pip and take the cash. \n\nJust ask your new company to join in 30 days and get the best of both worlds. \n\nSource: been a manager who executed a PIP and fired the most incompetent person ever who got a huge payout, versus not getting anything when I quit and moved on to another job.; Take the new job and just keep collecting paychecks from your old job until they fire you. \n\nGetting PIP'd for a dumbass reason like that with the knowledge that PIPs usually mean getting fired means I would just do the bare minimum or even less.; Yes, you should leave.  Maybe not without notice though.  \n\nWhat you should do, is try to negotiate a severance for voluntarily leaving.; Maybe you don’t deserve this 10k raise lmao; What the PIP says?; Bro take the 10k raise even if everything wa nice and dandy what what kind question is this; Pull the ripcord.; Had conversation with \"friend\".

   "Top Comments": "If you can sell yourself as 4 YOE, it's doable (I've done it myself). Regardless, I suggest a compromise where you really try to find a new job while staying employed for a couple of months, then you can quit if you haven't found a new job by then (or your lack of success might make you reevaluate quitting).; Something really important to remember is that currently-employed candidates are favored more than unemployed employees. It’s just how a lot of recruitment pipelines work. It’s also a lot easier to negotiate when you already have a job.; Your YOE is low. You will struggle to get a job. \n\nCan you get a few weeks off to recharge? Either PTO or unpaid leave?; Have you already started applying or were you waiting till you don’t have a job to do that? I would keep the job for now but try to aggressively apply to jobs while employed. I’d prob start half phoning it in at the job too while I look; I just quit my job 2 weeks ago, and i also have 2 years of experience with enough money saved up to keep me going for a while. Wish me luck.; I don’t know about you but, throughout my career, I have left SWE jobs maybe 3 times without a new job lined up.  It was the right choice for me and it turned out fine.; Quit. Cut your expenses to the bare minimum. Aggressively. Move back in with your parents if possible. Then go live your life.\n\nTake a couple months to do nothing - go on a vacation or whatever\n\nThen start working on yourself. Maybe make a game or try making your own app. It doesn't have to succeed and become a viable business but make sure it's something you're passionate about and that will teach you things. Be disciplined about it. After a couple months of that start applying for jobs.\n\nIf your job hunt takes over a year then you can start saying that you were working on your own startup that didn't pan out.; Why don't you just job search while performing uh... \"averagely\" at your current company? I dont understand why people quit first.; Get a job before leaving your current one; My friend did that and she’s still unemployed 10 months later.\n\nMy advice is stick it out while you look for a new job. Dedicate time in the morning or after work to applying to stuff and scheduling things. If you can step far enough out of the office, use lunch time for recruiter calls; if not, ask for accommodation. Find a time to schedule interviews; maybe try to do multiple on a single day so you can just take the day off (e.g. schedule a friday off and do 5 interviews).\n\nIt’s going to be even more a drag on your mental, but it’s usually much easier to find a job when you already have a job. I wouldn’t risk quitting to job hunt full time unless you’re already drowning in recruiters.\n\n——\n\nEdit: thinking about it a little more, I think what’s key here is that you get to a state where you have a lot of recruiters biting. Work on your resume and start applying to jobs every morning (don’t go all out day 1; just a few every day, with consistency, will do… tailor your resume if you have the patience… it gets easier as you do that because you can save tailored bullets and paste/uncomment them as necessary); someone posts this kind of question practically every week: [https://sh.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/1cpqrwn/my\\_job\\_bores\\_to\\_tears\\_i\\_cant\\_land\\_any\\_interviews/](https://sh.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/1cpqrwn/my_job_bores_to_tears_i_cant_land_any_interviews/) \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/154kjs6/when\\_will\\_this\\_tough\\_market\\_end\\_its\\_been\\_almost\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/154kjs6/when_will_this_tough_market_end_its_been_almost_a/)\n\n  \nI'm in a similar situation and this is the best answer I've seen so far: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/154kjs6/comment/jspd67x/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/154kjs6/comment/jspd67x/); You claim it's the worst thing ever, but have you even started looking for a new job?; We will all give you advices that are easy to give but hard to do because only you know your situation. I'd say health is always first; Do bare minimum and wait for them to pip you (or whatever the name is in your company). You might end up getting some severance.; Being unemployed puts you at the bottom of the stack. In better times you can get away with it but I wouldn't risk it. Quiting will make employers think you lack the discipline to stick with the job and that is as important as anything else.; No, just quiet quit until they let you go and collect unemployment + savings. Meanwhile, keep saving.; Don't quit. Make them fire you so you can get unemployment.  Coast and apply.  Maybe it turns out they keep signing your checks even though you're coasting.; Can you look at taking a few months of FMLA leave? I’m not sure if all the details but sometimes it’s unpaid leave and you may need a doctors note but I don’t think that would be too hard to get. Then you can take the leave and you seem to be okay without getting paid for a bit. Then you can keep it on your resume as employed and have a place to go back if you need a paycheck and realize you can tolerate it for a few more months.; 1) I would quit if my job was causing so much anguish that I basically hate being alive.  It doesn't seem like that's the case for you though? Is your workplace toxic or do you just disagree with how they manage their product?\n\n2) Can you get vacay/bullshiz sabbatical and apply meanwhile? Always a safer option than straight quitting and looking for something new.\n\n  \nI would really go for 2 man unless this place is causing you to straight up lose hair, hate yourself, hate your life, and hate everything around you.; I think you’d be better off searching while staying employed. Currently employed workers are more enticing from what I’ve seen vs unemployed."

   "Title": "Realistically, what industry roles require a PhD over an MS?",
   "Top Comments": "> I know the market is extremely saturated with even people with PhDs from top schools, so I don’t think it would be a wise financial decision to go back to school right now because it would be far from guaranteed that I would get one of these more “fulfilling” roles even if I did have that extra degree.\n\nThat hasn't really been what I'm seeing, but ML is always a gamble in that you want to not be working on things that will become a dead end by the time you get out of the program. \n\nGenerally, though, you should almost never do a PhD with the intent of private sector employment unless you know what you want to work on after the program.; ML. Some government and similar contracts require PHDs, thinking they’re necessary when they’re often not. ; Quant for sure.; For most people getting a phd, standard “industry roles” are not their concern. ; Sometimes quantitative finance firms will only hire PhDs but you have to be like the very best. My only source for this is one guy I know who’s a quant and he came into the firm with an MS from a top school and they had him finish his PhD; Research roles (like UXR). R&D roles (research scientist). Roles with a lot complex math/theories etc (CV/ML/AI). Roles that deal with complex data etc.\n\nFor the roles above we only hire phds where I am.; high level robotics maybe? like autonomous stuff, for actual algorithm design; My team hires exclusively MS/PhD and honestly I don’t know of many roles that truly require a PhD outside of fundamental research (e.g. professor positions or research scientist roles). It’s hard enough finding good hires requiring the MS\n\nEven quant hires MS. I had no trouble getting quant interviews coming from a T10 masters; Research at any degree heavy place. I Miraculously got hired into a place like that in the 80's with an MSCS among hundreds of PhDs. I learned a lot but it was a bit disheartening. Ten years later i wanted to get the damned degree so i went back to school at 35, out at 40... Bucket list item.; None. My experience is that the average PhD is a worse hire than a MS.; R&D in defense; [removed]; I have worked with a few PhDs and interacted with a ton. All of them from the big 4 programs. So maybe a small sample size, but in my experience there aren’t any roles that require it. That said, none of them have ever been laid off. They constantly have offers from startups asking them to come on in some advisory role or CTO level. They also get play from HFT.\n\nI am a better engineer than them, I don’t have a PhD from MIT/CMU/Berkeley. I don’t seem to get any of these opportunities, despite me straight up applying and networking with these people. It’s just my experience but big companies will hire you and won’t lay you off, and small companies will bend over backwards to get you onboard.\n\nMy advice is, don’t do it unless you get into a dream level program. Nothing against other schools but I haven’t met any PhDs from them at any Big 10 company I have worked at. \n\nAlso, really easy, look at your potential advisor. They should list where their students are now, those are mostly the roles you will probably be looking at. ; Roles that require new methods to be developed (pure or applied research, some data science) generally have a soft but near absolute requirement for PhDs.\n\nThey tend to be less coding/development intensive and more focused on going from 0 to 1.; Quantum Computing; From my experience, I haven't even bothered to interview PhDs when someone with a Masters and experience is applying. I'm sorry, but there is a stigma around those in academia as being unable to perform at the job as if there was some sort of trade off between practical vs theoretical. \n\nAt a certain point, unless you are looking to be in academia, more education can hurt your chances of being hired. Projects and experience start to outweigh. \n\nYou can still do the research. You can still publish. You can still speak at conferences.; I’m almost singularly interested in working in biotech in the future. I originally planned on medical school, but fell in love with math and coding in undergrad and made the switch. Regardless of if I go for the PhD, I want to work on a product that is related to medicine, or at least something this I feel is helping the end user.\n\nI’ve also considered machine learning based bioinformatics or something along those lines. I think my first move will see about volunteering my time and coding/statistics knowledge at one of the labs at UC Santa Cruz (the university that’s in my town) to see if I can get to work on some cool things without the PhD commitment for now; [deleted]; CV/ML/AI, in my experience doesn’t require a lot of complex math or theory in most industrial settings. Doing a PhD is quite helpful and can be necessary for many roles but most PhDs in those fields are removed from the mathematics and theory.\n\nI say this after having worked at a top AI lab with much disappointment at the lack of math and theory.; I'm intrigued.

Read books, learn a new framework, watch conference talks,  try to apply what you learn to daily work. Learning is a skill, and you've not practiced it, so start small, be it with a pattern or whatever. Don't get too hung up on what you're learning - you'll be able to make decisions about which rabbit holes to jump into later when you've done it a few times.\n\nAs for social skills... well... be social.

I just finished a final round of interviews with Amazon. You can get as far as you want in this career, recruiters and managers don’t really care about your degree. \n\nThe problem you’re running into is that the market is terrible for newer engineers right now. Lots of tech companies went on a spending spree when rates were low and so now they are all letting people go. For less experienced engineers the headwinds are brutal;\n\n1. Junior and mid level engineers are always the first to go, so you’re competing with more engineers at your level. \n2. The senior engineers who get laid off are now competing with you for prospective roles\n3. Businesses don’t have a big appetite for less experienced engineers because they are a long term investment. They need senior engineers who can hit the ground running and start delivering rapidly. \n\nI say just hang in there and keep at it. Maybe work on getting some certifications and start considering different roles if you haven’t already (DevOps, SRE, Systems Engineer, etc..) rates and inflation are coming down, I think it’s only a matter of time before things start picking up again.; no, not really sure why the comments are recommending it\n\nyou’ve got enough experience to be considered IMO; If I were you, I wouldn't waste 4 of my life again to get a degree.

And the credential lasts your entire career. Even if you can get a good job now, in ten years from now, the credential will still matter. If you are going to get it, it's better to get it earlier and start enjoying the benefits sooner, than go back and get it later.\n* Learning things outside of software dev. Do you have any interest in learning science, engineering, or math?\n* Math. Some math is actually useful in tech careers. Linear algebra, probability, stochastic processes, the basics of cryptography, even calculus + real analysis, etc. The main way to learn is by studying textbooks and drilling problems and that process is easier in a university course setting.\n\nCons of 4-year university degree\n\n* Giant amount of time + money commitment. You can take a single class per semester while working, but school will drag on for a long time.\n* If you have an unusually good career opportunity now, you might not want to forfeit that for school. But if you just have typical career opportunities now, then it might make sense.\n* Often, you don't use academics in tech careers. This often frustrates people who invest enormous efforts into academics, with the expectation that they will use it, and they don't.\n* Lots of jobs don't care that much. The credential effect is real, but on the flip side, a lot of companies don't care.; Start the bachelors. Put it on your resume with the dates you will be in school. I’ve been consistently getting offers using this method. Most places ask me if I plan on finishing and how I balance my time doing school and full time work. I’m honest and we move on.

This takes up roughly half the time.\n* Then you get asked technical questions from the following categories:\n   * System Design (design the architecture of a system, give a high level overview, explain how it all works, how it scales, etc)\n   * Object Oriented Design (design the classes, interfaces and methods needed for some kind of functionality.. focus here is on SOLID design principles, re-usable and maintainable code)\n   * Data-Structure and Algorithms (basically your standard LeetCode medium / hards)\n\n  \nYou'll have 4 rounds back to back, with maybe a small break after 2 rounds to let you get some water, etc. \n\n2 rounds will focus on behavioural + DSA\n\n1 round will focus on behavioural + OOD\n\n1 round will focus on behavioural + System Design; Between 4 and 5 for onsite. For sde 2 you'll have a system design round likely with the manager. People choose their own questions and difficulty can vary pretty widely; You may get more and better replies in blind ; You should hope they give you impossible questions so that you don’t end up working there. Your skills and knowledge are put to use somewhere else.; For behavioral interviews, answer with the standard STAR format (Situation, Task, Action Result) and keep their Learning Principles at the back of your mind to mix in your responses.; What’s wrong with working at Amazon as a SDE?; Check Blind. The mental health issue posts are near infinite. There’s a reason it’s called Shitazon.; Not a universal experience, but it is definitely likely.\n\nIf you're lucky, you get placed with a good manager on a good team with good work life balance. BUT it is the exception.; I feel like if you can breeze through an Amazon interview loop then there are many other options at places with better reputations you could be working so that you don't have to take this gamble to begin with."

   "Title": "What's best Python or R?",
   "Top Comments": "Python is a good starting point, and can be used for things other than data science. My advice is to take a good data structures and algorithms class and go deep. Also stats.; Both. As data scientist you have to know both.; Python, it's versatile, various use cases , beginner friendly, large community, rubust libraries.; In my Data Science master we used R only for the first semester, in the Advanced Statistics subject. After that we had everything else in Python, for its versatility and many libraries for data mining, AI and ML (pandas, keras, tensorflow...).\n\nI hated R at the beginning but ended up actually liking it after some months. If you're working mainly with statistical models and dataframe manipulations it's actually fun to use. I don't think I'll ever use it in the near future though, as I haven't seen many Data Scientist / Data Engineer offers in my area that ask for R. They however tend to ask for Scala as a requirement, so I will be trying to learn this language as well.; Python is often called a gateway language because it is easier to understand than other programming languages, so I'd start with Python over R.\n\nBash is my favorite scripting language, but I've found that after rewriting scripts to use Python instead, that the Python versions are genuinely easier to read.; Python’s a better choice, but you should also be conversant in R if you plan to have a career in data science. ; Some people seem to think R just has better access to more up to date statistical methods and what not. And some say you can use fewer lines of code.\n\nI find it hard to believe that these benefits are that big. But, python is definitely more widely used and general purpose.\n\nPython's type hints are also very nice for code completion and code navigation. I'm not sure if R uses type annotations as widely. I also prefer python's dot notation instead of R's preference for functional notation. It allows for better code completion.; learn whatever is being taught in class lol. But python is better than R.; That’s like asking if you should buy a hammer or a screwdriver.; I have never used R but I have written code in Python and there is no way it is best at anything.; Networking and operating systems. You’re gonna fix the hardware. AI is gonna do the software part.\n\n/s\n\nBut really not a bad advice.; [removed]; Thanks for the suggestions 🙏; I must learn both? Is it necessary?

   "Title": "[Student] Looking for entry-mid software engineering roles. Need harsh critique.",
   "Top Comments": "Very impressive (especially for a student), I think that most companies wouldn't know where to put you for entry-level roles\n\nIf you can seemingly lead multi-million dollar startups, cold applying to entry-level positions doesn't make any sense. Go through your connections instead\n\nIf you still are adamant about finding entry / mid-level jobs, you have to remove things like \"CTO\" / \"Lead\" / \"Head\" from your titles; Small detail, but not including your graduation date might be seen as a red flag. I would put that in and switch the location of skills and education so that people looking at your resume first see that you're a (soon-to-be) new grad, then see that you're a highly qualified new grad when they go over your experience. Your experience gives off mid/senior vibes for sure, at least the first couple listings, but it might be a red flag if they think you're a mid/senior dev with only like two YOE on your resume. I think communicating that you're a new grad first and foremost contextualizes that experience better.; Your resume is impressive but that’s not what gets a SWE job interview at most employers.  Most employers (except FAANG) hire people for a specific job, like Java backend engineer, and they will give interviews to Java backend engineers first.; Do your best in your internship. That will open a lot of doors.; That’s a busy year! I would put the school at the top then work experience then skills then projects. After looking at many resumes usually the people who don’t have school on top either don’t have a degree or they have tons of work experience.\n\nOverall I would be impressed seeing this. I might be thinking that you’ll probably want to go off and start your own thing and leave eventually if I’m hiring for a big company. But I wouldn’t hold that against you.; Big companies don't like hiring people with former (lead) startup experience. They typically view them as too much of a risk since they tend to leave to go back into entrepeneurship and use a corporate job to bide their time. \n\nHonestly, I think working at one of the more mature startups that will value your startup expertise would be a better way to spend your time than getting a job at FAANG which will almost certainly teach you nothing.; how's this? [https://imgur.com/zuAKVrf](https://imgur.com/zuAKVrf); that's a fair point. do you think that i'll have a higher chance of getting a job if I portray myself as:\n\n1. a new grad (putting graduation date), considering that this level has a crap ton of competition\n\n2. try to go for mid-level and leave the graduation date off and deal with the skepticism when it comes?; how's this? how's this? [https://imgur.com/zuAKVrf](https://imgur.com/zuAKVrf); That’s very true. But I’m trying to leave the startup space because I would rather coast by in my jobs and leave startups for fun.\n\nDo you think i would be better off just saying I was a regular software engineer at all of my startups?; I'm really just speculating, but my guess is the first option will work out better. The problem with dealing with the skepticism when it comes is you might not get a chance to - for example, if you've really sent it out to 500 applications and have gotten zero interviews, there could be a good chance that the missing graduation date is (for at least a percentage of the applications) causing people to just toss the resume rather than give you the benefit of the doubt that you actually graduated.; how's this? how's this? [https://imgur.com/zuAKVrf](https://imgur.com/zuAKVrf); I personally think that's a lot better, but I would still move skills to bottom or above certs.; thank you so much. i've made all of your suggested changes."

   "Title": "Engineers/Gamedevs who left a lucrative top tech job to make games: whats your story?",
   "Top Comments": "If you join a AAA studio you will be paid a good salary.\n\n  \nMy wife left G and moved to a very well known studio that makes mobile games and she makes\n\n  \n220k base +  20% bonus + 400k stock with 25% vesting every year + 50k sign-on bonus. This is at senior staff level. \n\nIf you join an indy or small studio, you will not be paid good money, so yeah, try to go to a AAA company.. but keep in mind that, for the most part, the job is not that different in a game studio rather than Amazon. You do some cool stuff, but at the end of the day, it's coding, and as a dev (even at a very high level), you won't have creative control, etc.; My best friend is a FAANG engineer who is working on an indie game with a couple friends from his company, developing it with Unreal Engine. He hasn't quit his day job, but the game is very much a passion project that he devotes a lot of time to. He never developed a game before this, but he's always been extremely opinionated on the performance and design of games he plays, and he is an extremely bright engineer so he's pretty effectively able to leverage his general understanding of programming to the problem-solving involved in game development. If these traits apply to you, I would take some time to try your hand at developing something outside of work and see how you like it.; My company is filled with ex-EA / ex-Unity / ex-EpicGames / ex-Blizzard people. And I’ve heard enough horror stories.; 1 - Saved up and did it.\n\n2 - No\n\n3 - Desktop publishing, team management\n\n4 - No\n\n5 - Own thing\n\n6 - About half\n\n7 - Don't do it unless your resume is strong enough to get a job easily when you back out; If you mean starting your own thing: Quitting to start a gaming studio is basically the same as quitting to start your own company. You’re going to need cash to feed yourself (and probably employees) if you want any chance to compete. Don’t go into it thinking you can make pixel platformer #207. You need to do research into the market you’re targeting (ex hardcore, mobile etc.) and make sure you understand how to monetize. The minute you start treating it like a form of art instead of a business, you’re going to become a starving artist.\n\nKnow a person who quit their job at Meta (formerly on my team) to make games on Roblox and Fortnite. Think he gave up making games on his own and now does contracts for bigger companies to make “metaverse” experiences.\n\nIf you mean just working on games: it’s not much different than amazon. Most things will just boil down to similar problems, but instead of your front end using react you’ll be using some physics engine or something; [deleted]; Amazon owns a game studio called Amazon Games FYI, you could try doing an internal transfer, it might be easier than switching companies given the market; If you listen carefully you can hear their quiet wails; I don't make games, yet, but I left FAANG to join a game studio. I do technically the same, backend services, but now for gaming. I want to make my own stuff at some point, but my savings are not strong enough to totally quit a job. \nBut now that I'm closer to gamedev, I'm learning a ton about the industry.\nNo regrets. I did take a hit on payment, but WLB is better and I like what I do more than before.; I worked at big tech for 6 years, 4 of which was at Amazon. Now I'm working at Epic Games for the past 4 months.\n\nHowever I'm still doing backend work, not directly on games. From what I can tell, game dev is a pain in the ass. Engineers here seem to have a worse WLB compared to the other companies I've worked for. Deadlines are tighter.\n\nI guess some of this really depends on the company and team, but things are more chaotic here at Epic Games. Constantly shifting requirements because of bad planning by senior management, slight culture of fear.\n\nWith that said, the company has competitive pay and benefits. Best healthcare plan I've gotten, 1 month company wide vacation, which is on top of unlimited PTO. I don't think most studios matches these benefits.; 1) I built a renderer from scratch in directx12\n2) I had a lot of hobbyist experience\n3) I had to learn the basics of modern graphics\n4) Yes I would do it again\n5) Established\n6) I got pay bump\n7) Do it if you think you’re going to regret not giving it a shot!; You don't need to leave your job at all. Just... start making games. Godot is free and getting really good now. There's obviously Unity and Unreal but also pico8 and even Playdate. \n\nYou just have to be okay with the idea that your game isn't going to make a billion dollars (or any money), and you have to scope out something simple, and you have to sit down and work on it and not get distracted, and then eventually you'll have a video game. Repeat that enough times and you might have a GOOD video game.\n\nMaking your own games on weekends is much more fun than working on a tiny chunk of someone else's idea all week.; I wonder if people leaving your company \"go on their new adventure\", too? Or was it just a phrase popular only in my department? When I quit my FAANG job I quipped that my next adventure is an adventure game, literally. And this week I got into Bethesda Verified Creators, so by the power of NDA I will shut up now.; Working in AAA games is going to have WLB worse than Amazon.  If you are working on a AAA game, you're just a cog in the machine doing JIRA tickets, just the same as in a regular software job.\n\nIf your dream is to \"make games\", what you really want to do is indie game development.  In that environment, you control 100% of the game, rather than just being a cog in someone else's plan.  It's also EXTREMELY competitive.  You can make a good game and get 100 sales.\n\nI realized it's just to financially irresponsible to quit a good software job to make games.  I decided I'm going to wait until I have enough saved to retire outright to give it a try.; … wlb exists at Amazon? :O; There is WLB for someone working at Amazon ?!?! Which IT area of AWS / Amazon you work in ?; what roles have creative control?; does your wife's role go through long periods of crunch? if so, how do you two make it work when that's happening?; how did she go from non-video game dev to video game dev? did she make games on the side?; Zynga?"

Legally, they can't fire you for it (although it's very easy to fire you for \"something unrelated\"), but be prepared for some grumbling about time out of office on drill. \n\n\nIf you want to be a federal employee, those veterans preference points are a huge leg up (ironically, unless you want to work in DoD which tends to ignore them).\n\n\n\nEither way you're not locked in to your life choices right now, you can always pivot. This is the kind of thing you should talk about with people who actually know you're life, randos online aren't going to give much insight since it hinges so much on personality and values.; Private, go Reserve/Guard if you really still wanna serve.; I say commission and go army because Job market is garbage; Thank you; Thanks. I have worried about my career in private sector conflicting with drill if I went that route. I will look into federal work that wouldn’t mind me being in reserve.; I just want to do something in ml/ai and I know I wouldn’t be able to in the military but not sure what’s out there that is cool with me being in reserves.; I think you have a couple of flawed assumptions. First, there's a ton of AI within DoD (as there is literally everywhere else, public and private sector). If you do a bit of googling it should be easy to figure out some places you could look. Second, you're probably not gonna land an AI/ML job in the private sector. Basically everyone wants to be there at the moment, and so you're competing against people like the laid off AI/ML/DS FAANG employees, and the CS PhDs, and so on. Your chances here may not be better (and in fact might be worse) than trying to land an AI/ML position. \n\n\nAgain, this is all vague and hypothetical. If you're doing ROTC at like MIT then this is a very different conversation than like the local community college. You should have a serious conversation with the people in your network who can point you in realistic directions for your current situation (your colleges career office, your ROTC network, etc.)."

I'll skip it\n\n\nThe whole team going to go karts for a work day rather than the office was pretty sweet and I had a great time. I certainly had a better time than an average day at the office; Yes, plenty of people enjoy these outings and hanging out with co-workers outside of work.; Gotta be honest with you, I’ve never met anyone working in tech who looked down on these kinds of events and especially called them “mandatory fun”, who weren’t by far the most annoying people to work with. \n\nIn my opinion it’s a shitty attitude to have when in most cases it’s just like a manager or whatever trying to do a nice event for a team. I know people have this idea from ages ago that tech is a career for like all the weirdos or anti-social people to work but that just isn’t the case. Unless you’re like a superstar, I promise you eventually no one wants to work with someone who makes no effort to engage. \n\nYou don’t have to be best friends with everyone on your team, hell you don’t even have to enjoy the events but frankly if someone flew out to go to your event and you just decided you didn’t wanna bother, then yeah I’d say that’s just a bad attitude, super childish.; Yes. They aren't just pretending to enjoy it.; I mean, it's fun. You get to meet your work friends in real life and get to know everyone better; I work remote on a fairly small team. My co-worker lives in the same city as me and we were friends before being on the same team. Our boss is about an hour drive away so he sometimes comes down to visit. We usually block our calendars for the full day and go out for meals and drinks. Not much work talk tbh and mostly shooting the shit. Occasionally we’ll plan meet ups when there’s a vendor who wants to take us out to dinner since it’s not on our dime. Last vendor meal we had was a steakhouse where we must’ve spent like $150 per person on food and drinks. Hard to say no to a free dinner especially when the vendor and boss travel to where I live lol.; I am extremely extroverted and am a musician and love talking to people, especially other engineers because they tend to also be musicians.\n\n  \nAlso I don't buy the whole: \"your co-workers are not your friends\" line of thinking. Some of my best friends are ex-coworkers. They tend to be people in your peer group who you have a lot in common with. So saying \"they are not your friends\" is a bit reductive. However, I do think it is important to keep it professional and to not put anyone in a weird position, especially during work hours.\n\n  \nHonestly if you are not socializing at work you are putting yourself behind. Who is the team lead going to promote: the person they like working with, or the person who is a grump all the time?; I like my team. We usually go out during work hours. I'd meet them after hours too but that's rare. If I'm being honest, I'd almost always prefer to go home but I know it's good for me and good for everyone that I do the fun things with the nice people.\n\nOn a related note, back when I did consulting, one of the pieces of advice I gave to new hires on my team was to try to always say yes to social invitations in the first 2-3 weeks of a contract. When you show up to a new team, a lot of people will be polite and invite you to join them on their usual social things. Maybe every Wednesday a few of them go to a ramen place for lunch and talk about movies. Idk. But they'll likely invite the new person to be polite. If you say yes, you'll not only quickly build rapport with them but you'll forever be part of the ramen movie club even if you never go again. If you say no to the initial invite, there's a good chance you'll never get a another one. I instinctively accepted every invite when I started out in consulting because I could hear my mom telling me it was the polite thing to do. And I later realized it made a huge difference in my success on new teams.; If you enjoy your coworkers, yes, it can be fun to interact with them in a non work setting; One of my fondest memories from a previous job is a team outing I organized!  When I was a team lead part of my job was to setup quarterly outings for the team.  One summer one of my engineers asked me (jokingly) if we could go to Cedar Point as a team outing.  For those of you not from the Midwest, it’s a big theme park that is one of the premier places for roller coasters world wide.  He assumed there was no way I would ever approve it.\n\nBut I looked at our per-employee budget.  Did some math.  And realized that if we invited the other teams that worked for my manager not only could we go,  we could get drink and food wristbands for everyone so meals were covered, *and* we could pay a bussing service to haul everyone from the office to the park and back.\n\nSo we took a whole day of work, bussed like 25 employees from our office to Cedar Point, spent the day there, and bussed everyone home.  Nobody spent a dime, nobody had to drive, it was a huge, huge success.; Yes, you're just an anti social asshole.; It's a bit of both. People do enjoy it, but a large part is also being seen by the company and playing office politics.; Depends on the outing.  I still remember when the movie Snakes on a Plane came out and my whole team knocked off an afternoon to watch it.  Pretty good time.\n\nLack of socialization with teammates has been one of the hardest parts of going remote, so I'd jump on the chance to travel for a team get together.  My company has a cool program where they send groups of employees to a vacation home in a tropical country (the CEO owns it and pays himself with company funds to rent it during the slow season...), and those trips have been a blast.; It depends on what it is, but in general I really enjoy them! I've been to many like going to Top Golf, dinners, movies, and other various ones. It's always a good way to cut loose and get to know others in a more relaxed setting. It all depends on your perspective though.; lol I used to fly into a city for team events, cuz they didn’t know I wasn’t in the state. \nI enjoyed them tbh, like if I lived in a state I was working in I would go more. It’s great to hang out and also play the game and be likable; “Mandatory fun” in the military is different, mostly because everyone is *already* spending so much of their time with each other that it’s hardly even a break from work. \n\nI’ve found corporate events to be much more fun. Everyone’s looser and you’re more than likely doing an actually fun activity instead of burgers and dogs at some rundown picnic area on base.; It depends. Team outings in which business function is expected to be put on a halt in consideration for the employees are fun. \n\nBut if having a team outing means you end up staying late at night to finish your work, why bother with an outing? \n\nSame ideas as Lunch and Learns. Good companies don’t take personal time away from employees. Good companies make time. \n\nBe the change you want to see in corporate business culture. The older generation is leaving behind some toxic standards. If you don’t want to do the outing, don’t do it then. Save time for yourself, the option is there. The flexibility is part of modern work.; Do **people** actually enjoy team outings? Yes\n\nDo **all people** actually enjoy team outings? No (me being one of them)\n\n Is it a *\"corporate culture, playing the game to get promoted type of thing\"*? Sometimes, it depends on the company. Not as common in software engineering as it could be in other cut-throat professions. It's usually just for fun; Most people seem to enjoy them. I certainly do.; i think it also depends how old everyone is too, and other factors like if they have a family or not. I would assume a team with ppl in their early to mid 20s compared to someone who is their 30s"

You can work your whole career at companies that force you to burn the midnight oil, and your life is consumed by work. You can  also find plenty of companies where the work is more chill.\n\nYou can grind and chase those massive 400k+ TC positions, or you can work your whole career in the $100k range.\n\nThe onus is on you to find a company that fits your desired lifestyle, and desired pay.; Easier, sort of. There's always new stuff to learn but you should have a good base to build on. Things like languages and frameworks change, new tools become available, but, at the heart of it, your job is to solve complex technical problems. For example, my first programming job, way back in 1989, was sending data from one location to another. My current job often involves the same thing although the tools and methods used to do it now are vastly different.\n\nAs for the long term, you have to find a career path that works for you. Some people go into management. Some don't. Some leave the profession. For me, I went back to being an individual contributor after doing some time in management and hating it. The main thing I recommend is having a good financial plan since this will give you more options as you get older.; Eventually you will find something that you really like working on. By liking something, you will put more effort into it without realizing and become a subject matter expert. Your expertise will be valued above your other generic skills, so you will be asked to do more things that you like. \n\nAs long as you are lucky and pick a framework or a language that sticks around for a while, you should be alright. If you are unlucky and have to learn an entirely new tech stack every few years, you are gonna have a bad time.; [removed]; [deleted]; I’ve been doing it for almost year and a half. It gets better but when the seniors talk about system design I feel completely clueless, don’t know how steep the learning curve for that is supposed to be 😭; Yes; na its about the same because each problem is a new one.; Not necessarily \"over time\" but \"with breadth and depth of experience\" - as with everything. \n\nThe more familiar a problem the easier it is to solve, *and* the easier it becomes to recognize and apply prior lessons to solve *other* problems. \n\nThat's what learning & problem-solving *are*, and those are foundational skills in any career field that requires using your brain. \n\nSwitching to medicine won't eliminate that - it'll just mean your learning & problem-solving skills have life-altering consequences for patients. You'll still need to constantly learn new things.\n\nOnce you're comfortable with \"meta\" tools & concepts that apply across projects (CS theory & vocab, version control, command line tools, debuggers, proj mgt tools, etc) much of that knowledge transfers to the *next* new technology so you can focus solely on learning the new stuff. The learning curve always trends higher, but it flattens out a bit. \n\nFinding new things confusing is totally normal. Put in the work to ask questions, research topics you find confusing & then build little toy projects to understand things at a small scale before applying those lessons to bigger problems. \n\nIf you find that you *hate* doing that research & constantly learning & building stuff, then yeah maybe look into another field, because that's a huge portion of the job (but again it's true of medicine as well).; Why not do medicine if everything you do is going to give you a mental breakdown?; Thank you!

Helping patients who didn't want to help themselves, dealing with insurance companies that go against you, dealing with other providers who weren't cooperative. \n* Having to let go of things you can't fix. Sometimes due to how healthcare (at least in America) works you can't fix every problem. Some people can do that. I had trouble with that at times.\n* Higher stress environment (at least in the field I was in). In my SWE job there are definitely stressful times but it's a different type. More of a \"I gotta get this project done\" kind of stress, something I could manage. In healthcare, you might have emergencies. Could be a patient having a health emergency, but could also but an angry patient yelling in your clinic. You have to be able to handle these sudden things. \n* Most jobs are patient-facing. I actually felt comfortable being an explaining role but as an anxious person I would always be afraid of second-guessing myself if I didn't have my sources. In SWE I can attach documentation that I'm referencing, or I can point to the code and explain my train of thought. In healthcare a patient asks you a question and it is your job to be the main source of information, which I wasn't able to be comfortable with doing at the time."

I doubt anyone's going to value your JHU degree more than OMSCS. There's even other things that might be fine, like any accredited MS program, like some Oregon State one. Most companies just want to know if you can code and have the background knowledge from the degree that you should have. It may just be a waiting game for you now, with the current economy. And definitely review how many applications you send out per day. Some people send out 1 application per day and then act all clueless as to why they can't get a job.; I was actually looking into the JHU program. I liked it, but it required too many prereqs so I decided to go to a similar program with no prereqs. \n\nI think it's good to learn formally, but some experience would be better. Esp in tech stacks that are actively being used in the industry. Keep at it and Leetcoding and hopefully you'll get something.; If you're going to switch careers, use your start up experience to make your own tech start up.

   "Top Comments": "Read. Books, technical documentation, blogs, GitHub projects.\n\n(But not Robert Martin, please.); I feel the same. At your job, you usually just follow the standards set by your team. \n\nIf there's no standards, you can certainly try to research one because they are many. Each with their own specific use case. \n\nOverall, my model is that there is no right way of doing things. There are only wrong ways.; Stuff like that will come over time, and standards evolve too. You won't be able to learn them all really quickly, so try to pick them up as you go. You could try learning the standards of what you're doing as you go. Do you have to setup auth in your app? Dig into the industry standards. Working on the UI and you realize you need to share state around different areas? Learn the standards. Otherwise if you just try to learn them all now, there's just too many across so many disciplines and topics. And it's arguably not as useful. Like why bother learning the standards of event driven architecture if you don't need it and your current problem is how to get users registered for your app.\n\nFor how to approach it, I'd recommend just doing research as you approach new topics or problems, but also ask someone. If you have anyone that's a mentor or someone you know with some experience, try to lean on them too.\n\nThen there's the standards that your workplace has. Always follow those standards first. And if you have any disagreements with them, bring them up and challenge them, but don't deviate from them just because you feel differently. Most team/org standards exist for a reason.; Who cares if people use it? Users don't care about the coding standards. That's not something you should sit around whining about, tbh.; Thank you very much, can you give me some links and book recommendations to get me start?; >it may be insecure\n\nSo you're indifferent to application security then. Good to know.; Not without knowing what technology you're working in and what kind of standards you mean.; What are you on? I never said \"it may be insecure,\" nor that I am indifferent to security practices.\n\nDo you have any evidence that he's working on security-critical applications? Because I don't see any in the OP...; I am using React, GrapgQL , Postgres and Firebase. I mean standards to ensure security. I don't have that much knowledge but I also mean, when you make a website for example, use session storage not local storage.; To see the evidence you'd have to read the OP before shooting off, which you obviously didn't do. Here, let me quote from the OP for you:\n\n>it may be insecure; Not really my area.\n\n[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=react+app+security+examples](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=react+app+security+examples)  \n[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=owasp+10+code+examples](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=owasp+10+code+examples)\n\nExcept I will say that leaving user credentials in session storage to be passively deleted is not a complete logout solution. An application should actively log out from the server if possible.; That's hardly proof that anything is insecure, or is even anything that requires much security. It's a wild guess for all we know. You keep believing everything you read without applying any critical thought, if that's what you want.; Thank you so much.; OP is building a web application for people to use. As I said, you're indifferent to security, but by all means keep bitching because someone pointed that out.; He didn't say he was doing that in the OP, which apparently you need to review.\n\nI'm not indifferent to it, but he can learn it the same way he's learned everything else, which isn't \"sitting around whining and bitching\" like the 2 of you like to do."

MIT or Stanford puts you in an elite club and alumni network that is far superior to the other options.\n\nDon't let people who can't see the forest for the trees skew this reality. \n\nIt's not just about compensation or TC. It's about options, it's about 10 years, from now, 20, 30. In 30 years that degree from Stanford or MIT will open doors, impress people and reflect upon you possitively. Sure, someone from some no name school could go further in their career make more money etc than someone from an elite private school. But it's like poo pooing the advanges of being tall in the NBA because Spud Webb was competitive in that league - you would be crazy to willingly *choose* to be that height is you wanted to play basketball.; Always better to go to a top private, except Berkeley and UIUC, if you can afford it; I'd imagine you'd have to be like top 5% of a top public university to be maybe the equivalent to the top 10% of a top private university. If you're essentially looking at entering the part of the tri-modal pay bands where you're one of the biggest fish in the world.\n\nOtherwise, I think everyone from either place can pretty easily enter the middle part of the tri-modal band pretty easily. And wouldn't expect too many folks from either place to enter the bottom band.\n\n[The Trimodal Nature of Software Engineering Salaries in the Netherlands and Europe - The Pragmatic Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/); For MLE if you're talking about creating and training ML models you're going to want a masters/PHD because most job posting require them, and many of the top companies pay a ton for that. For example, Applied Scientists (MLE + SWE) at AWS pay the most per level out of any job family that I know of.; It won't matter if you're only applying to shitty web dev jobs.\n\nBut you probably won't be applying to shitty jobs like that if you graduate from MIT or CMU.; If we're talking truly top universities, then I don't think it matters, assuming you do well, which is a big if (and private universities are going to have more grade inflation and generally make it easier to do well). \n\n\nThat said, it's going to be extremely difficult to land an ML role coming out of undergrad, regardless of university.; There is no difference. Companies that pay well for early careers (like big tech) don't care about public vs private. TBH they don't even care about school ranking that much.\n\nAlso there are a lot of quants from UIUC since it's near Chicago :) prob the same/more than a lot of top private schools.; I went to public Virginia Tech, my high school friend there got recruited by Microsoft and moved to Seattle. Microsoft had a special presentation and a large career fair booth. Oh it's not elite enough for your list is it? I did Electrical Engineering and had 3 paid internship offers and 2 job offers at graduation. I turned down other opportunities that didn't pay enough.\n\nThat's the thing. You're overblowing the importance of this but you're here to ask so that's fair.\n\n**University prestige matters greatly for first job at graduation. Then probably never again.**         \nWhere I went was the top rated program in the state. Every major company in the geographic region recruited there. Virginia company probably isn't going to recruit at higher ranked Georgia Tech in Atlanta.\n\nBut prestige isn't a Top 10 list. It's Top 2 in your state or Top 10 in your geographic region. That's all you need. I had friends at CMU and they did as well as my CS friends at VT for finding work in their respective geographic area.; To add to this, my 2c: I wouldn't recommend going into extreme debt for it, but there are many companies that will at least interview you if you graduate with a good GPA from a prestigious (Ivy-adjacent) school, even if you don't meet the posted qualifications. This also holds true across certain white collar industries, which allows for a higher degree of job flexibility.\n\nIt will not guarantee you a job, ofc, but in this job market, it is an advantage if you are able to get your resume in front of a real live human being.; Sure, but unlike height and basketball, somebody \"under 6'\" (aka not an elite school) shouldn't feel as though they have to be a rare talent to make a high TC/get incredible opportunities. A lot of it is how hard you work/how well you work on a team/luck/perseverance ; It is not about options 10+ years from now. Survey after survey shows university only matters for first job at graduation. That matters. You have better job opportunities at graduation. You can start 1 pay tier higher and keep being a tier above the rest, or get passed over in the next 10+ years.\n\nEither way, prestige isn't just some Top 5 list. Most people want to work near where they live or went to college and companies can't just cherry pick 2 places on opposite ends of the country. Best or second best in the state is all the prestige you need.\n\nMIT and Stanford alumni networks after graduating $150k in debt? I went a huge land grant university with a huge alumni network. Active alumni chapters in every city, every company has many coworkers who went there, including recruiters. This all helps me. If I give enough money, I get Division 1 FBS tickets.\n\nOn the other end you got Virginia Military Institute. An extremely small military college ranking in nothing. No graduate degrees offered. Every grad is guaranteed a job in the state of Virginia. 100% guaranteed. You just go to go through hell freshman year.; UIUC is a top 5ish cs program in the country. I would argue that's the main reason why there are a lot of quants from there. Location is nice but a smaller factor. You don't see any quant firms hiring from Columbia College Chicago.\n\nSchool rank definitely matters, public/private doesn't though.; > TBH they don't even care about school ranking that much\n\nMicrosoft has a booth at the Georgia Tech computing career fair. They don't have one at University of Phoenix.; But your previous employers matter - work at Databricks as a new grad and you'll probably have your pick for your next role, etc.\n\nThe median new grad salary at CMU is 2.5x that of VT so you must have had some fantastic friends at VT or bottom of the class friends at CMU.; Totally missing my point.; Try to get an automotive industry job without an engineering degree from a big ten school or a few top nationals (Caltech? Where's that /s). In some cases it does matter. In architecture it's hugely important never mind reality and schools capitalize on it bigly. \n\nI've interviewed geniuses from bottom of the barrel schools and morons from ivies. The degree and school reputation does follow you around a lot longer than people or surveys think especially for regional hiring.; Meh, sounds like cope."

Really the only thing this shows is that this guy worked in a bubble for 10 years and is in a for a rude awakening by reality.

It opens by admitting a psychological co-dependence on Google for his very identity as a human being, and then takes some potshots out of butthurt.  Pro-tip - if your FAANG employer is your core identity, it implies an ego and insecurity problem, and you need to work on disentangling your id from a organization that is not your family and doesn't *really* care about you, but only to the extent you advance the org's interests more than its next best alternative.  Next best alternative is constantly shifting and in flux and you have little control over that, thus little control over your identity and happiness.

You can say \"I don't mind this process (lying), but wouldn't it just be better if we got it right the first time?\" \n\nTo me it sounds like you do not have appropriate acceptance criteria and you also do not have the proper safeguards against people just changing there mind willy nilly.  \n  \nYou need a working agreement in a confluence that is endorsed and signed by stakeholders. It should state something like: acceptance criteria to be written with the input of the stakeholders and dev team, agreed upon by the dev team and stakeholders. If stakeholders want something different after the work is delivered, stakeholders and the dev team will need to reconviene and re-write acceptance criteria.   \n  \nEssentially you need to make asking for changes expensive for them so they have a vested interest in making up their damn mind the first time rather than treating your time as worthless. \n\nMaybe check out Behavior Driven development as a guiding framework\n\n[https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd/](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd/)\n\nRegardless, you have to speak up and tell people this is a shit process and in general, they will probably agree with you. Again, frame it in a way that sounds better for them \"wouldn't you like to just get what you want the first time rather than having to sit and nit pick every little detail and then wait for me to redo the work?\"\n\nBy the time you get this working, maybe you have found a new job :) good luck!; Not to sound discouraging...but this is pretty much software development. You will have to deal with these challenges in varying amounts, in some form or another, for the rest of your career. See this as an opportunity to learn how to control your anger and frustration, manage expectations, set boundaries and pick your battles. Surviving corporate life is a kind of game that one learns to play and this is not something you learn at college. Above all, look after your body and your mind.; I communicate very clearly that I will build the things on the ticket to the specification of the acceptance criteria. Every stakeholder question starting with ‘why’ is answered with ‘wasn’t in my a/c’; Have more frequent meetings with the stakeholders to show progress and discuss requirements and expectations. That way you can't go too far astray with what they want. ; Yeah that's frustrating af. At 1yoe, they can't just specify vague business needs and ask you to implement it without all the details. Have you tried asking for all the details thoroughly before working on it?; If they are going to pick apart your work anyway… you could start building things that are vaguely in line with the vague requirements but faster to do. Then you will be throwing less work away. \n\nIt’s kind of iterative development on the sly.; [removed]; Thus we have a question. We have applied like 10 thousand of app, and no luck. How come this girl is accepted? Is that really because we don't do leetcode?; >I’m literally spending 100+ hours building projects from scratch only to have to redo large portions.\n\nWhat did you think you'd do as a dev? Changing code is your job. Maybe get better about asking people more questions.; Read up on Agile and become an ambassador for change. Demo, get feedback and don't do the whole thing without buy in.; How much does that make you per year if you dont mind me asking; I don’t get why people hate the idea of PMs, it’s awesome. They just say hey do this does this make sense and you tell them yes or no. No BSing around with stakeholders or management etc. define a task and just let me do it hell yea; My direct manager is technically the PM but idk I think he cares more about not upsetting his boss vs anything else. Very much a “yes man”. After me as a developer, it goes to him as a director then to his boss as a sr. Director so it doesn’t surprise me.; Feel free to record it/screencap it too so you can say, “sorry it seems like there is some scope change here following the sign off I received from stakeholders in our previous meeting”; Yeah, that’s the type of expectation for senior eng and up, with the help of PMs. Entry level you’re essentially supposed to have very clearly defined tasks handed to you and complete them in a reasonable timeframe. Once you show you can do that then you get handed more vague ideas and asked to define the solution yourself and solve it.; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

   "Title": "Play politics at workplace ",
   "Top Comments": "People who say playing politics is pointless are clearly people who have no work experience. There will eventually be a ceiling for those who do not participate in some kind of politics.; Take any government job in the uk for 6 months; The term is overloaded. You're not actually asking something specific that anyone can answer. Everyone has their own definition of the word and it's VERY broad.\n\nCorporate politics can be everything from a positive way of ensuring effective and positive change occurs, a necessary evil in dealing natural human interactions in large groups, sociopathic behavior to manipulate others for your own benefit, a way of surviving and even thriving in toxic work environments, etc.\n\nPolitics WILL exist in sufficiently large groups of humans. We just don't have the mental bandwidth to solve problems through careful, face to face, considerate communication among groups larger than 50 or so. And we have a lot of built in social and problem-solving mechanisms that, if you understand them, helps you be more effective with these interactions.\n\nI will say this, though: I don't think you're starting from a strong place. Let me explain.\n\nWe all have a tendency to view our own mistakes as the result of circumstance and the mistakes of others through as the result of nature. We cut someone off because they were in our blindspot, someone is tailgating us, and some distraction happened. A mistake, but understandable. But when someone cuts US off it's because they're a selfish jerk. When OUR deliveries are late it's because of organizational blockers, impossible to anticipate additional complexities, poor requirements, management changing priorities, etc. But when someone on another team is late, obviously they're lazy or incompetent.  Our biases are understandable, but we're open minded and open to change. Other people are obviously just biased in their world view and unwilling to take the blinders off.\n\nEffective politics is based on understanding how people think and perceive the world.\n\nAnd the way you have characterized your co workers and environment makes me think you're not able to see the perspective of others. I'm not saying there AREN'T people who are just cruising. But PROABABLY it's not because they played politics. That happens, but USUALLY people fall into that for a variety of organizational reasons.\n\nIs favoritism happening? Probably. Is it due to politics? Maybe. Sometimes. Usually not. Usually it's just squishy human emotions where we grow relationships over time due to proximity and compatibility and then inherently trust those people more even when it's not justified. \n\nAre some people better at getting what they want or effecting change? Sure. And sometimes it's due to conscious politicking. Well, let's give an example there.\n\nWhen it involves me the answer is yes, it's politics. I'm a high functioning autistic. I had to learn interpersonal communication academically by study and experimentation, because I have a learning disability in regard to naturally learning human interactions. So I'm very aware that the way to make an initiative stick in an execs mind is to coordinate with 2-3 other people to bring it up separately. Execs are busy, interact with too many people, and the way humans work in groups is the brain only really considers an opinion when they hear it from 3+ sources. What I DON'T do is just assume they're brushing me off, trying to save a buck, or resist challenges to their authority. I have to understand their actual perspective (lots of reports, lots of ideas, too many meetings, too many decisions, also out of work distraction == not enough mental bandwidth to effectively consider every request coming in)\n\nBut for MOST managers, it's not politics. They're just social. They talk about things they care about with several people, seeking consensus, those people may bring it up with an exec, the exec hears it 3+ times and their brain flags it as something to consider. \n\nThat's politics. Effective communication and consensus building among large groups.\n\nIf you're not naturally good at it, the way some social people are, you get good at it by studying human interaction  mechanisms and then getting very good at understanding other people's perspectives.\n\nThe things you have written (they're able to be lazy because they are playing politics, obviously that's true because I don't even know what they're doing with their time), whether true or not, tell me you aren't yet able to make good assumptions about the reason for the behaviors of others or what their perspective likely is. I can almost 100% guarantee they would not agree with your characterization.; Politics sucks. Just keep asking questions. Don’t say yes or no right away and potentially piss off stakeholders or other teams. Lead people to your thought or idea by having a conversation, rather than trying to dictate. Play devils advocate if you disagree with something.; Hard to know if “politics” to you is just socializing, which is critically important for any role.  General gist I get from many, usually young, swe is that the work itself is enough to guarantee favoritism, recognition, and employment.  It’s not.; Most politics are not evil or dirty. Politics is about forming relationships with people and helping each other. Not in an evil quid pro quo way but genuinely helping out when you can. The simplest way to start is finding something you have in common that you can talk about. It can be anything like sports, cars, movies, books, whatever. You don’t spend an hour talking about something because we’re all busy but just brief little conversations. “Did you see that football game last night? That was crazy! I thought they were going to pull it off.” “Have you seen Fast and Furious 24 yet? I don’t recommend it.” “How old are your kids now? Man they grow up fast. My kid just started college.”\n\nOver time you build up enough relationships with people and when you need help with something you know who to call. And it goes both ways. People will call you, too.\n\nYou can say this is stupid and choose not to do these things but this is how the world works. You will never get very high up in an organization unless you have relationships with people.; Read “Difficult Conversations” by Douglas Stone.; A company or a government without politics doesn't exist because the some people's ideas have to win. But when politic becomes a Oligarchy. There will be no idea. Best company, idea win. Weak company, politics win.; What is the outcome that you're looking for? For people to be punished for slacking off? Just ignore it unless it directly affects you.; 1. Read How to Win Friends and Influence People. It is a classic for a reason. \n\n2. Spend as much time as possible trying to see things from other people's perspectives. It's hard to know how other people are likely to take things if you aren't good at this.\n\n3. Remember that perception is everything. Being perceived as likeable, smart, hard-working, capable, etc. is far more important (in a corporate politics setting) than actually being those things. (See #2 for more on this.); An organization is literally a group of people, and politics will always be present when there is a group of people.; It’s impossible to not have it. \n\nEven if you have a team of only engineers, one is the lead. Boom politics; Can you elaborate? B; Most people operate like chatgpt (you me give a task and I’ll do it) and think they are much more valuable than they are. Real value to an org is brought through collaboration, consensus building, creating ideas and executing on them (which ultimately leads to increased revenue, productivity etc…) . People who do all the above effectively either rise up the ranks or are generally well respected and a lot of the above activity is political in nature.; >I'm a high functioning autistic. I had to learn interpersonal communication academically by study and experimentation, because I have a learning disability in regard to naturally learning human interactions.\n\nSame here. I'm a director level as well and in the exact same boat. Late in high school I realized \"you suck with people but you are good at learning -- learn people\" and made a very concerted effort to do just that. It has paid career dividends. \n\nI'm naturally an introvert and an asshole, but that doesn't come across at the office.; I'll play a different kind of devils advocate here:\n\nPolitics are the natural and necessary result of humans working in large groups. We have not the mental or social bandwidth, nor even the TIME, to handle communication and planning in large organizations the same way we do in smaller groups.\n\n* Politics is just effective messaging and coordination of large groups. It's things like:  The first idea said gets heavier consideration of it's merit, regardless of how good it is Humans naturally flag incoming opinions as valid if they have heard it from 3+ sources, so having multiple people repeat an idea to an executive is an effective way to get something past their subconscious filters to get real consideration\n* Leaders don't have very good mechanisms to get a feel for day to day realities of what's being done. For them, MOST of the time they ONLY know what they are told. Effectively gossip IS their reality, right up until a release happens, quarterly reports are delivered, etc. They will build relationships of trust based on the *feeling* of what they are being reported and *who* is reporting to them.\n* When reality hits (often after MONTHS of illusion) they will have to make sense of the new information using older, incomplete information. Existing relationships, biases, and paradigms will heavily influence how they interpret new events. \n* If the event was BAD they will naturally be trying to avoid experiencing that again. But they will be building a puzzle with imperfect information. And what information they have, how accurate it is, and how good they are at parsing it will have BIG effects on the rest of the organization.\n\nI could go on for a while, but I'll stop there.\n\nSome people's natural social instincts serve them well in those situations. Other people learn it academically. Some of the best people at navigating these situations both started with good instincts and then later studied the realities of large scale human interaction, coordination, and messaging.\n\nIt's not good or bad. It's just...reality.\n\nThe bad comes from the fact that when someone learns and uses politics for personal gain at the expense of others it has VERY wide spread effects. Also the fact that, for whatever reason, people willing to do that seem to be more likely to actually study and improve their political skills.; Politics is when bad people do things I don't like.; People who rise up are idiots who only know how to play politics"

   "Title": "Why do they keep pushing this narrative ?",
   "Top Comments": "Is everyone aware of where Pasco is? It’s very rural. Their comment is probably because most, if not all, of those companies won’t allow for fully remote work if they allow for it at all, so the shortage is probably real. \n\nThat said, all of these companies made their own beds, now they can lay in them. Let them struggle/fail. They deserve no sympathy or influx of grads.; Because there is a computer science worker shortage... of those with 10 years of in depth technical work experience using the exact same software stack as the company now uses, who are ready to start generating money on day 1 with no training whatsoever, and willing to work for $60k in person.; Because they can't say things like \"We need to juice these enrollment numbers with a CompSci program because the rest of our undergrad degrees have trash earning potential and everyone knows it\"; Because the education industry doesn't care what is really happening, all they care about is their business, selling education.; They fell into the \"infinite growth\" myth, e.g. \"the line keeps going up!\" \n\nI don't know why people fall for this every time. A lot of people here on this sub did too.\n\nWe are in a bubble of CS grads. I remember when the exact same shit happened to law schools. People were telling humanities grads \"go to law school and you can get a nice office job!\" So people did exactly that, and there was a bubble until it all came crashing back to Earth in the aftermath of the financial crisis when law firms were cutting back hiring and laying people off. Enrollment dropped so much from 2010-2014 that many law schools closed. \n\nIt's the same story playing it out. Perhaps genZ is too young, but I've seen this movie before as a millennial.; Shortage of talent, glut of resumes; Thats how the colleges make money.; It's probably just some local reporter who isn't kept abreast of current tech hiring trends. If you send an email to the paper and asking where they got the idea that there was a tech hiring shortage, and that there's been hundreds of thousands of software engineers laid off who can't find work. They'll print a retraction and update the article.; The biden admin along with big tech is currently trying to remove a visa rule to allow more foreign workers in because they are claiming there is a CS/STEM shortage in the nation. This is intentional to get cheaper workers they can treat poorly. \n\nhttps://www.techtarget.com/searchhrsoftware/news/366583437/Microsoft-Google-seek-green-card-rule-change; There’s a lot of money being put into saturating the market. The goal is cheaper engineers for the next couple decades, not to fill some kind of vacuum.; You don't want to work in the Tri Cities; Because it’s very profitable for universities to sell students on this fictional tech labor shortage. It drives unqualified people to go for CompSci or cybersecurity degrees when in reality they’d never be qualified for those career fields.; The more desperate people you have looking for s job the worse salaries get because you take ehat you get.\n\nNot saying thats the reason but... It could be.; Money. Colleges always pump out worthless degrees for people who will get no use out of them. In the 90s it was journalism. I would say most of my fellow students in my journalism classes never worked in that field a day in their lives. The market wasn’t that big or that lucrative. But colleges kept creating degree programs and pushing students into these careers they weren’t cut out for.; Tech workers salaries will be \"too high\" for the taste of business owners so long as software developers earn more than average. Being able to hire talent for $20/hour will properly address the \"shortage\" in the eyes of management.; > Why would you say there is a shortage if you have thousands upon thousands of people in this sector looking for jobs \n\nAre you looking for jobs in the Tri-Cities?; Because schools are money making institutions that want to get more paying students in order to grow. Anyone can get any degree, at any school, and have a loan pay for it? Basically, we’ve created a system where schools compete on features to attract more students. A fancy new CS degree? That’s a nice feature.\n\n\nHistorically, there has never been a lack of engineering training. People who can be good engineers, especially in software, are capable and willing to train themselves to do it. All the info is available online. The issue, is that we lack the engineering talent that is good enough to independently be a net positive economic contributor. We can never have enough of that, since these folks create jobs, but there is a pretty big skill gap.; One of the tri-cities is Richland, where PNNL is located. I doubt if they'll let you work remotely on Top Secret stuff.; > Why would you say there is a shortage if you have thousands upon thousands of people in this sector looking for jobs ?\n\nWithout resorting to google maps, would you be able to put your finger on \"Tri-Cities\" on a map of the US?\n\nHonestly, reading the article, it suggests there is a shortage of \"Computer Science Grads\" in the Tri-Cities only.  Which is probably actually true... because the tri-cities is balls.  I don't interpret it as part of a \"Ermigawd college graduate shortage...\" narrative.\n\nThere's a reason Hanford was built there, and it wasn't because of the super smart local population.\n\nPlus like, you know what generally can't work at Hanford??  H1B's from China.  Something about nuclear rabble rabble plutonium rabble.  I don't actually know about the current major contractor that runs cleanup at the site, I am curious if they're on the H1B train.  It was WGI a while ago, and CH2M, but I thought it transferred operations relatively recently.\n\nMy vote, is this is no news.; Money"

Though I only knew them for about half a year, maybe more, we had a good working relationship and I left the team/company on good terms. Fast forward to today and I see an opening at that company that I'm, at least in my opinion, a good fit for and said colleague is now the director of that team. \n\nIs it considered professional/acceptable to reach out to them for a referral? If they were a former colleague in any other position I wouldn't think twice but it feels weird to ask the person who probably opened the requisition if they could refer me."

   "Top Comments": "People have said front end is dead for 20 years. Dreamweaver was supposed to kill it, then Wordpress. It’s really just an endless hype cycle. If you want to make it as a front end developer, prioritize your soft skills and your algorithm skills to a degree. no one thinks about the problem solving issues of front end, but that’s the hardest and will not go away; Generally, frontend is much harder than some people may think.; Because people think frontend dev is making something appear on screen. That's the easy part. ; I hope that there will be still a need for  humans; Thats what i want to imply, there were many tools tired to replace but couldn't.\n\nDoes ai really replace that work?; In my experience, no. At least not yet. You can't just translate the whole design concept / layout from the \"picture\" to the working code and expect it to function like a real project. Or rather you *kinda* can, but only if your \"project\" is super simple and doesn't require any adjustments to the generated output  and doesn't have any external dependencies - which is absurd. It does require adjustments. A lot! And any frontend has some form of backend system behind it. So, to me, the question is does the process of generating \"boilerplate\" and then methodically adjusting it through prompting actually increases my productivity? So far, the answer is no. It's much quicker and cleaner for me to cobble up first draft using my own snippets / components and go from there (extending, styling, etc)"

Speaking from experience -- this type of negative thinking will only result in worse imposter syndrome when you start working professionally.; no u should learn B; There are probably better tings you could spend your time on.; [removed]; Nope that's for S tiers only. Go power up noob.; >with bootcamps and self learning.\n\nC/C++ will help you cover OS/Low level knowledge that is typically not prevalent among bootcamps \"graduates\". While you may never write any C/C++ or system code profesionally, it will help you write code in general to understand better the platform on which it runs.; C++ is easy. Anyone can learn the basic in a week.; Learning C/C++ for professional purposes without a degree might be moot depending on your experience and education outside of CS. I say this because a lot of C/C++ roles also require computer science knowledge beyond the basics, which isn't something you'll pick up as you learn to program.\n\nIf you already had experience in the industry, it'd be easier, since you'd have the basic SWE hurdles out of the way already - but for entry level without a STEM degree I'd suggest devoting your energy to something else for now.\n\ntl;dr not permanently off the table but the technical knowledge required to both perform the tasks of and learn on the job for a C/C++ role are an additional threshold on top of basic software engineering, and regardless of your actual competence it will be more difficult to convince an employer that you can do the job without a degree; No; Don't try to go into tech market now.

Better PTO, more technology flexibility, and potential to become mostly remote. Compensation is about equal, and if you think you want to stay within gov/consulting work then the TS/SCI will be a big help to already have that done.; I say Company 1 unless you're going to fail the background check. 3.25 days is the worst I've seen outside of consulting. I'm used to 10 days, that include sick days. Holiday separate. Front end is limited opportunity. What's fully remote now may not be in the future. I got forced into the office 4 days a week after 3 years of work from home and I'd have been laid off if I didn't relocate. 10 minute commute is nothing.\n\nThe 5k extra is 3.5k extra after taxes. 30 PTO days is incredible for US under any circumstances.

There are 10 recognized federal holidays (I know not all of them are realized on by the company) and I'm not sure where OP is from, but in my state sick time here is 40hrs or 5 days. That would put that in line with offer 2 in terms of PTO.\n\nI agree with most people here that full stack is generally better in terms of career outlook, but for all intents and purposes, time off is the same.; location?; If you have a gf in another state that you want to live with, you should take fully remote. Fully remote is very hard to find nowadays, it makes your options very wide. Tho the full frontend is tough.; Company 2 ! Unless you enjoy socializing with coworkers / being in office. I wouldn’t rely on the “mostly remote after awhile” because each team most likely handles that differently ….also the company can always mandate in person / increase days in person.\n\nDo you like frontend? I think focusing on one stack at a time is easier (better work life balance) + the experience will let you have a much deeper knowledge on frontend which you wouldn’t get if your time was split between many things.; Is Company 2 3.25 PTO days total, or can you accumulate more and get the standard holidays off too?; I wouldn't be whining about having to come in to work when the commute is only 10 mins, but you do you.; This is the correct answer. Take job 2 while you work on your clearance for job 1.; omg i’m sorry. i meant 3.25 WEEKS. apologies; I’m stupid and meant 3.25 weeks. But beyond that, thanks for the points you listed!"

   "Title": "Is it worth getting certifications while job-hunting?",
   "Top Comments": "Are you interested in cloud storage at all? If you are, you might want to consider getting a cloud certification in specific. For example, I have an AWS SAA (Solutions Architect - Associate) cert and that cert exam is super heavy on the databases. The exam does touch on all AWS services, but I feel that at least 50% of the exam (current edition, C03) was related to database stuff.\n\nYou basically kill 2 birds with one stone there.\n\nNot sure if the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam has been discontinued yet, but I would not recommend getting that one if you were considering it. Most companies want to see at least the SAA level cert. The Cloud Practitioner is okay, I guess, but it is mostly surface level stuff and doesn't delve deep into the AWS technologies, so I don't think it puts you at much of an advantage.\n\nOther than that, I think Oracle has some db certs worth considering.; Definitely worth it, many enterprises look for certified individuals. But the thing is you’ll learn great deal about working in real-life scenarios from these certification preparation which has always helped me in making the right choices in work as well. \n\nBut make sure you don’t burn yourself out, you’re looking for a job, doing your personal project, and preparing for a certification. Be mindful about your time and energy management. Best of luck!; Cloud storage is one avenue I’m looking into! Having a certification that actually teaches me valuable information is very appealing. Did you have any extra resources for the AWS SAA that you appreciated during your time preparing for it? \n\nI appreciate the warning on the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam as well, I’ll keep that in mind while I map out my plans and orders. Thank you so much!; Thank you for the advice! I’ll do more research on which certifications I’ll target.\n\nAnd you’re right about the burnout, I’ll work on getting a good balance going as i get started!; I used Stefane Maarek's Udemy course to prepare for the SAA exam, but that is because my company paid for it. There are a few other recommended course options, and you can find them under r/AWSCertifications.\n\nI do think you want to take an online course for this cert, though, because while you _can_ learn it all yourself, the course instructors are AWS certified and tell you exactly what you need to know for the exam. I mean, there are more advanced exams than the SAA cert — such as the AWS SAP-C02 (Solutions Architect - Professional) — so it is helpful to know what is or isn't a topic for the SAA exam. Otherwise, you'll go crazy trying to learn everything.\n\nBtw, the SAP cert is really aimed at jobs like tech support where you're expected to know the inner workings of like every AWS resource. As an engineer, we don't need that level of knowledge (IMO) unless we are providing that kind of support for some reason. So yeah, an SAA course can help you not go too deep into that rabbit hole.\n\nFinally, to stress the difference between AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect - Associate: I would say the AWS Cloud Practitioner is like skipping college and doing a 6-month CS bootcamp instead, while SAA is like getting the actual CS degree."

I know everyone is different, but I (10 YOE) do not immediately think it is a red flag when I see a new grad lose their job less than 6 months in. I mean, it is certainly possible they got fired for doing something egregious or stupid, but most of the time, companies consider new grads as a cheap investment that will pay itself off over time, and it does oftentimes take at least 6 months for a new grad to fully ramp up. (Sometimes it takes less, sometimes it takes more, but it depends on the role and company for sure.) So, companies usually _don't_ want to let new grads go right away unless it is a cost-cutting thing like in your case.\n\nNot sure if that helps you feel better, but yeah, I do not think this looks bad for you in particular. It would be very different if you had 20 YOE, started a job, and then lost it within 5 months. At that point, people tend to assume the worst (whether it is true or not) that you got fired.; I was in a similar situation as you.

Every new job you start will have you drinking from the firehose. Even after you have expert level understanding of the tech stack, each environment has its own quirks and issues \n\nWhen you join a new company, the first big hurdle is usually getting your initial environment setup. Some places have this down to a simple script, but most of the time you have to do a bunch of troubleshooting. Don't feel bad about asking questions when you're trying to get the application built for the first time. It will probably take some troubleshooting with more experienced developers. \n\nIf you're working in a scrum shop, you'll usually get assigned tasks during spring planning. The stories that you get assigned for a sprint should have clearly defined acceptance criteria that give you a clear idea of what's expected of you. If you aren't sure how to fulfill those acceptance criteria, make sure you ask questions. It may be that you lack context, it may be that the acceptance criteria aren't clear - trust the more senior developers' opinions on which is the case.\n\nThe most important thing for you as a junior developer is to learn from the people around you. Make yourself easy to teach and let people know that you're eager to learn and you should do fine.; Work with your manager mostly and communicate when necessary. Your disabilit(y/ies) don’t have to define you, and the focus should be on the work. Make sure to ask for help or accommodations when you feel you need it, too.\n\nTry to take the job one day at a time instead of worrying too much into the future. You’ll also get more used to it the more time you spend there, so it’ll be a little awkward during the transition period. I think you will be fine.; So some advice I give to new joiners.\n\nQuestions are welcome, and encouraged, but also try and find out it out yourself first. \n\nSo any questions you might have, check the company wiki / google it first quickly before answering. \n\nI also like to write down the list of questions i have during the day, so I can kinda ask them all at once opposed in piece meal.\n\nGood luck!; Hi. Where do you find your job? I guess you are on Bay area?; Thank you for your comment, I love to feel like I'm learning something so I'm always open to learn.\n\nI've historically been bad at asking questions because I feel awkward, but recently I've been learning to just ask away without shame.\n\nWhen I mentioned not needing to learn the basics I meant the least common denominator of all companies, which should be decent JS, HTML, CSS, Node, etc.\n\nBut surely there is always more to learn and I'll find out that I still don't know how much I don't know.; Thank you for commenting, I'll keep all that in mind.; Thank you, that's pretty much how I act normally so I hope I can do the same at work.; Hey there, I live in Brazil. I found the company on LinkedIn and sent my resume on their website and as soon as a job opening showed up they instantly scheduled an interview.; Yeah, I've had similar hesitation around asking questions. If you're interested in learning and you're willing to put in the time to research things a bit before asking questions, I wouldn't worry about it. Good coworkers will be interested in helping you. I know asking questions can be difficult, but that's your greatest skill as a developer.\n\nI hope things work out for you! It's a great profession for those of us who enjoy the work. I'm 15 years in and can't imagine a better way to use my talents. I love having endless opportunities to learn and improve on how things are done.; Thanks, it's genuinely refreshing to see someone with 15 yoe looking at their job like that.\n\nSometimes when learning I feel some kind of energy that literally makes me feel like life's worth living.

Are you being given the time back plus interest? \n\n\nThen what the heck are you and your boss doing?  \n\n\nAt this point you're undoubtedly delivering SLOWER than off you had only worked 40h per week. You're not even making your employer more money than if you were more disciplined.\n\n\nLearn to be a professional.  A professional knows how to manage their time.  How to estimate.  And how to communicate slipping dates. That's just as much a part of the job as coding.; I think you have to stop working 12 hour days and work 8 or fewer. That’s the problem with doing a job faster; that becomes the new expected standard, even if it’s unrealistic. I don’t know what’s going on with your team members and them encouraging a work schedule that promotes burnout.\n\nThere is the fear of layoffs, but if you burnout then you may just end up laying yourself off, so doing your job sustainably is definitely important.\n\nTry to have a conversation with your manager and tell them that they can have it in 2 days, but the code quality will be poor, there will be no testing at all, and no QA. If you want the bells and whistles, then they need to pony up and allot more time for the feature.\n\nBeing a developer isn’t a good counter argument to why a feature doesn’t deserve the necessary time it needs to be built. If your manager doesn’t want to consider your input and point of view, you have a toxic manager.; You have a manager problem. Estimates should be done by the whole team, not over ridden by the manager; No amount of money would make me do this. You have limited time on Earth. You push back and set boundaries. You establish reasonable deadlines based on what you can accomplish in an 8 hour day. If they don't accept that then you quit or get PIP'd. You'll be better off either way.; Microsoft wrote a great book about this called 'Debugging the Development Process' - a must read.\n\nIt's about their Excel team which was massively underperforming. The manager of the time was forcing the devs to do what you are, working into the early hours, working weekends etc....\n\nA new manager came in and although it sounds counterproductive from a productivity point of view, he immediately ban all over time and weekend working and forced a standard 8 hour day on everyone.\n\nThe result?\n\nA complete turn around in productivity.\n\nSoftware development needs concentration for one to be effective. Working long hours destroys this both for the day you are working those hours and the following day.\n\nWhat you are going through is a poor management problem that should be addressed.\n\nPersonally, for me, I would point blank refuse to work those hours unless they paid me eye wateringly high amounts of money. I would just walk, because these kind of jobs are not worth it.; Does this Big Tech company have a fast-paced environment and Elon Musk-style management? That right there is the problem.\n\nYou want to move to a more lax, boring industry like insurance, government, or energy. I work at a big insurance company and I pretty much goof off 4+ hours a day regularly, my job is remote 5 days a week, and the managers barely even attend our meetings. I can literally take a 2-3 hour lunch at my favorite steakhouses during work hours, get pissed drunk, and no one will bat an eye. I also make six figs. Having no wife and kids also helps; Sounds like your manager is technical in the sense that they know how things worked and theoretically should work, but not technical enough to know that developer practices and requirements have evolved to a point where there's a lot of overhead and slog. I've witnessed a few managers do this where they hear of this great cool paradigm/best practice and introduce it to the team every month or two, but fail to experience how it actually feels like to adhere to 24/7.; I'm sorry, but it's your fault. You need to stop letting people walk over you. Say it's 6 days and if they give you less, work only 8 hours a day a finish it when it is finished.; Your manager is shit. Quit this job ASAP. Are you getting paid very high salary to deal with this shit ?; Been a software engineer for a looong time and companies and careers go through phases like this. As a starting point, it's important to realize that working this way is not sustainable over the long run. You and your colleagues will burn out and that is not in your or your manager's interest.\n\nWhat to do about it? There are no easy answers (besides changing jobs). Perhaps transition to estimating in hours instead? Then you can separate the size estimate from the working hours discussion. 24-hour task? Yes, I can do that in two days, but three days is more realistic unless it's an emergency.; Work 8 hours per day. Period.\nIf you can’t finish the task you simply say it’s going to take more time. What you’re doing it’s not sustainable so if the company expectation is to work you to the ground then let them lay you off.; Just don't do it.; Log off right at 5 and start applying to other jobs. If you get fired you get severence. Win win; There's a possibility here that you're doing too good a job fulfilling unreasonable goals, which is burning you out, and your insensitive manager is concluding that you can do these goals when he pressures you appropriately.  You need to stand firm and also work reasonably.  For example:\n\n>4 days for this ? It's simple enough, should be 2 days at most.\n\nThis is where you say: \"No, it isn't.\"  If he insists on it being 2, then just say that you'll work on it and if it turns out to be 2 days then you'll let him know, otherwise expect it will be 4.  Then stand firm, work through the problem at a good pace, don't kill yourself, and don't stay extra late.\n\nSomething you learn over time is, things take as long as they take.  Estimates are just that, estimates.  When the job is done is when you actually know how long it took.  Keep that in mind.; Can’t get laid off of you’re dead.; Rule of estimates: double your estimate for anyone asking above you; Why is your manager setting estimates? \n\nEither he is an asshole that will impose dates or not. If he asks for estimates then THE TEAM should set the estimate. And THE TEAM should make sure it estimates correctly, not him.\n\nHe, as a manager, can't have it both ways.; > strict deadlines\n\nWhat happens if you miss one?  Seriously, you're doing this to yourself, and they're taking advantage of you.  Bad economy or not, you're expensive to replace.  Work reasonable hours.  Don't let them abuse you.  I know how much easier it is to say this than to do it (believe me), but just do it.  If they do actually fire you for refusing to work 80 hour weeks, you'll at least be able to collect unemployment while you're looking for a better job with better management.  The alternative is dying from a heart attack at 38.; This clearly isn't sustainable. If you can't establish a reasonable boundary on time estimates by working with your EM, normally this would be escalated to your skip\n\nClassic case of managing up; Ask more questions before agreeing on an estimate.\n\nYou need to push back more. Your manager sucks for cutting your estimate in half. A good manager would've doubled an estimate instead. If they say it takes half the time, then let them do the work lol. Strong \"it works on my machine\" energy there.\n\nHalf-assed estimates deserve half-assed efforts"

That means the alumni base is tiny too. A big alumni network helps a lot with job prospects. Throw in the fact they also aren't ABET accredited and there just isn't a lot to like.\n\nI'd try to find info on job placement and median salaries for their graduates. They likely can't share it because the dataset is too small, but if you compare to some similarly ranked NY schools, it doesn't look good. See [College Scorecard for NY Schools](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/search/fos/?sort=fos_median_earnings:desc&page=0&cip4=1107&cip4_degree=3&state=NY). The difference in earnings expectations between some of their potential peer schools (Pace University for example, which is in the top 200ish for CS) and a higher tier school like University of Rochester (top 100ish) is pretty big. If you're looking at 30-50k per year lower earnings potential, then taking on some debt to go to a better school could be worth it.; Regional accreditation is important for getting visas for other countries and also some government jobs. You're cutting off a lot of job opportunities and investing a lot of time for a degree that's not accredited? Pass.; No. Find at least a top 100 university, or persuit other fields. This market is very bad even for top 30.; Going to a unaccredited program is really going to hurt you. I’d avoid that.; So to clarify, the COLLEGE Is accredited under the MSCHE. This is the same one I’m seeing for the local state schools. Would it be okay then? To my knowledge, there isn’t really a computer science specific accreditation at this point that is seen as “the one to get and if you don’t the school is shit”. Am I wrong? It’s a full four year program, so it’s not necessarily a boot camp of sorts but he is delving into boot camps this summer prior to getting started with his first semester coursework. He’s looking to get CompTIA certified this summer as well (I have no idea what comptia is for the record, just saying this because my brother mentioned he’s thinking of getting it); Could you take a look at the following link? The tabs “post campus curriculum” and “post campus courses” are the courses he will be taking and I have no idea if this will be worthwhile. So sorry for the trouble, unfortunately I don’t have a background in CS so I’ve had to resort to Reddit. Unfortunately the LIU college is doing grading/grad ceremonies so it’s been impossible to get in touch with anyone but those I have spoke to have told me not to worry and that next week it should be getting back to normal. \n\nhttps://liu.edu/about/~/link.aspx?_id=BF5513D80CC44DD19B9CBF0844CB365E&_z=z; Yes but the issue is he is getting a full ride here and everywhere else he is getting literally no money. Wouldn’t it make sense for him to just stay here for two years and then transfer into Stony Brook? That way he only takes loans out for the last two years.; So to clarify, the COLLEGE Is accredited under the MSCHE. This is the same one I’m seeing for the local state schools. Would it be okay then?

I went to an ivy league school and their program is not ABET accredited.; If the college is accredited he’s fine. Free is the right price. Just googling this school wiki says it’s 100 years old. That’s not a scam. I assume he’s actually going to be enrolled in the college and attend class on campus and get a bachelors degree through this program? If so then it seems like a good deal.; Nothing necessarily seems missing from their program.; Is there any way to check if Stony Brook will honor most/all of LIU's transfer credits? I'd be concerned about that. It could be a better play to do 2 years at a community college and then transfer if SUNY has tie ins with the community college system. In my state, you can enroll in community college programs that guarantee transfer credits into the state's university system. I don't know if that is the case with SUNY though.; I believe you are correct in that CS has no major accreditation, but it would be a bad sign if other majors in the school weren’t accredited; ABET is sort of the \"one to get\" accreditation. For whatever reason, this is an unpopular opinion on this subreddit. But there is some truth to it. ABET isn't just some random group of cronies trying to tell colleges their program sucks. It is one of only two accreditation bodies that accredits degrees that will allow you to become a licensed Professional Engineer. Currently, the software profession doesn't require any form of licensing so the ABET accreditation isn't required like it is for a Civil Engineer. But it does mean some experts that take this stuff seriously confirmed that the program you're attending meets some minimum requirements.; Everyone on this sub went to either an ivy, Stanford, or Carnegie Mellon. /s\n\n\nFor the handful of us that ended up picking between a handful of state schools and obscure private schools, ABET accreditation does have meaning. \n\n\nAnd I assure people that plenty of hiring managers are worrying about it. We know that there are some great programs outside the top 25, but we also know there are garbage programs. And one tool we have to compare the lower programs we are unfamiliar with is whether or not they have ABET.; Would you mind taking a look at the following course list in the link I attached below? He is going to be on the Post campus, not Brooklyn. They seem to have two entirely different course structures! Now I’m very ignorant so I don’t know if it will still be sufficient enough for his overall learning and preparation for his career to land good jobs. I spoke to a professor that runs the department and they told me that when the Brooklyn and Post campuses merged together, somehow the course structures remained a bit different. He tried to assure me though that the quality of education is still incredible (new state of the art facilities/research grants for students).

   "Top Comments": "It looks like it is regionally accredited via MSCHE  to me. That is the normal accreditation for Mid-Atlantic states.    \n\n\nOr are you talking about ABET? Just for context, Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University don't have ABET accredited C.S degrees. That should tell you how (un)important ABET is for C.S.    \n\n\nC.S is a formal science (like Math and Statistics) imo, and should be treated as such. It isn't like traditional engineering programs like Electrical Engineering or Civil and Environmental Engineering. So the ABET accreditation doesn't make as much sense for it.   \n\n\nEdit: To clarify, regional accreditation is the normal and good type of accreditation because it is older and has more trust. \"National accreditation\" is what one needs to be wary of, because it is newer and what diploma mills would get. Specialized program-based accreditation like ABET only matter for certain degrees, and C.S isn't really one of them. ; ABET is important for engineering degrees, not CS degrees.  While it is possible that they exist, I have never seen a job posting or a graduate school application demanding ABET accredited CS bachelor's degree.\n\nAs long as the university is regionally accredited that is all that matters.; In my opinion, a person’s success as a SWE depends more on them being personally proactive than where and how they learn.; ABET doesn't really matter for CS. \n\nI am unaware of LI's CS credentials, but if your brother got into a significantly better school without a full ride, I think it's worth assessing the merits of taking on some student debt for the prestige. It probably isn't worth it though unless it's a notably more prestigious CS school.; If you are talking ABET accreditation, I'll quote my HW engineering professor. (I have computer engineering and computer science from non-abet acreddited programs)\n\n> They want me to teach you a bunch of stuff you don't need to know and to not spend time on a bunch of stuff I know you need from my time in industry and making my own products. People in this field do not care about if you are ABET accredited, they care that you are a good engineer. So that is what I will teach you.\n\nNo one actually cares about the curriculum standards in this field. Your ability to *do the job* is what matters as long as you have the degree. (Unless people are hiring based on university, in which case you don't want to work there anyways); It’s a free ride and no one cares about accreditation for CS.; He will be fine. Accréditions doesn’t always matter unless you’re trying to transfer to a uni abroad.; [removed]; Does it matter if it’s accredited? Like do prospective employers know which cs programs are accredited if you don’t?; You mean it's not accredited at all? Not even nationally?; Wow the usage of the vernacular “mid Atlantic” was a stark reminder that I need to brush up on my knowledge of ocean names. And honestly I wasn’t really talking about MSCHE or ABET specifically, I don’t really have any experience with CS since I have an accounting/finance background myself. I was just used to seeing programs be accredited so I wasn’t sure if it was a concern. I just hope the quality of education is okay. The small size of the school makes me fearful that good employers may not recruit from there, but if I’m not mistaken do private colleges typically have better recruitment opportunities than SUNY? I could be completely wrong as I went to a SUNY myself and am only 26, so I haven’t met enough private school folks to confidently believe they have better opportunities just because they came from private.; > Just for context, Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University don't have ABET accredited C.S degrees. That should tell you how (un)important ABET is for C.S.    \n\nYou're kinda cherry picking the top end CS schools....\n\nThis is like saying Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college so it tells you how important college is.; >That should tell you how (un)important ABET is for C.S.    \n\n\nI think it's important to explain why top tier programs don't have ABET degrees instead of saying they don't matter because xyz doesn't do them.\n\nA) The universities you listed have explained that their incomming matriculates already meet the required prerequisite course requirements for the core curriculum.\n\nB) ABET signifies to employers a graduate is more likely to be a qualified candidate. By virtue of going to an Ivy, you already get that etherial qualification.\n\nC) Combination with engineering degrees (BsEng) gives them tigher constraints on classes. This compunds with D below.\n\nD) Naturally Ivy schools have brigher students than the average bears so a structured program is not as necessary to success as non Ivy schools.; I have seen job postings specifically state ABET accredited CS degrees as a requirement, but like you said very rarely.; I'd hazard a guess that is mostly because of the market up to this point. Only recently has the market had enough people to even kind of match demand (and even then, this is mostly at the entry level, there is data to suggest at mid and above levels the biggest market issue is a mismatch of skill needs).  \n\nThis naturally leads to looser requirements, because if they're too strict on that they get no one at all.  If the market reaches something close to equilibrium like other more traditional engineering fields, it would not surprise me to see ABET requirements for certain \"prestigious\" positions.  Don't know if we will actually get to that point soon, but makes logical sense to me.  Even if that does occur though, probably would be greater leniency on folks that have been in the field since there are some truly amazing CS programs without ABET accreditation currently.; A CS degree can be an engineering degree. I have seen and currently work at a company that requires ABET.; My only care about whether a school is accredited is to make sure it’s not a major scam kinda, but mostly so you can get federal and state financial aid. ; Extremely false in this economy.; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

   "Title": "Is there a difference in SWE post grad salary/salary progression if I go to GaTech vs CMU",
   "Top Comments": "If you only care about prestige, go to CMU.; CMU has some of the best stats for getting into very prestigious jobs like quant, faang, top unicorns. But GT is also pretty high up there. I think the biggest difference is less CMU students and imo that’s a good thing from a very prestigious school because it’s like seeing a diamond in the stack of resumes. It’s the same way I view Stanford vs Berkeley tbh.; Hard to say because salary depends from person to person. But I do think CMU has a \"wow\" factor that GA Tech doesn't have. It's possible that OMSCS may have diluted the GATech brand a bit, although it remains a good program.; CMU is more prestigious but in terms of industry I feel like I meet WAY MORE people from GT (probably just cause of how much they accept). I'm not sure if they actually send more to top tech companies, but I do know I meet a lot of them. Potentially better networking? Haven't personally met anyone from CMU yet, but that could just be me.; Yes, CMU guys get bonus bj’s.; CMU is way better if you care about quant at top firms. It's a real target school. Gatech won't get your resume thrown in the trash, but you'll need to be a top student to have a chance.; I work with a bunch of people from CMU and GT (mostly graduate school, not necessarily CS). Pretty much all good.\n\nThe primary factor at cohort level in difference in school outcomes is type/quality of student admitted (secondarily, network/recruiting/alumni effects). I wouldn't overthink this. Both would be good.\n\nI would choose based on how the campus feels and what you think about the cities. You need the right situation to grow and thrive, and success comes from your efforts.\n\n(CMU has more prestige for CS to be sure); Don't go to CMU unless you are going to another country post graduate that really care about international prestige. I know a couple extremely talented CMU grad who didn't find a job this cycle. Go with much less expensive and almost as good.; It doesn't really work like that. It's more what internships you land and who you network with. Neither of these schools are particularly prestigious. Your career progression will depend way more on what you can do and who you know coming out of school rather than which school you decide to go to.; No one cares what school you go to. It is probably the least significant thing a hiring manager looks at.; So you’re saying discarding prestige GaTech is the better option ?\nEdit: to add to that, I care about prestige to the extent that it’ll help me get a higher paying job and network . If they both will get the same level of job and connections then idc; I don’t plan to do quant. For SWE/ML Engineering is there much of a difference? I could also get my masters from GT in the same time it takes to get my BS from cmu; Neither of CMU and GaTech are prestigious???????????? WTF\n\n  \n[https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us](https://csrankings.org/#/index?all&us); No, I meant CMU is more prestigious than GaTech. In terms of other aspects, you can probably check the university's subreddit.; I can say from my experience at a couple well regarded big tech companies that there have been more gt people than cmu, but not by nearly as many times as the difference in student population. Like maybe 2x more GT folks even though they have 6x more CS major undergrads. Leads me to believe they have a much higher conversion rate. \n\nI'm not sure how that changes when you factor in that you'd probably be a way above average student at GT and walking out with 2 degrees. You'll probably be very successful in either place.; I've never heard of them; [removed]; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

My undergrad was computer science and very little of it was industry-like software development. We had 2 courses of software engineering where we made some basic websites and that was it. Then a web dev basics class, a networking class, and some database administration. The rest of the CS courses either taught programming languages, programming paradigms like OOP, theory like Finite Automata, computer architecture, or electives like Computer Security. Then the rest of the degree was math.\n\nMajority of what you're going to learn is probably going to be outside of class on your own time while class teaches only the basics. Unless you need a degree to get past applications or want to go into roles that require advanced degrees I dont see the point. I personally enjoy reading so I typically pick a topic, scour the internet for best books on said topic, and just go to town on reading it and keeping notes. If you already have your foot in the door, a textbook is a hell of a lot cheaper than college.\n\nI do acknowledge that your options might be limited to web dev without a degree, in which case it probably would be beneficial to get a degree if you wanted to branch out. However, going simply cause you think a class can teach you better than the internet can isn't something I'd advise. Especially cause some professors just absolutely suck at teaching and you'd end up learning mostly from the textbook instead.; I was thinking things in college will be better at teaching me software development and maybe I could break out of web development only."

My company uses splunk for logging, datadog for metrics and sentry for critical alarms, and I get a LOT of use out of these.

Obviously a recent interview experience, esp if rejected, isn't going to win them over, i see that more now. \n\nit feels like that specifically for this question - describe a difficult decision - that vs another candidate, my project would have to be more complex, my decision more critical, the risk of my decision more severe, my way of coming to resolution more creative, proactive, rational, and more successful. maybe i'm just ranting now.\n\nugh, sorry thanks for listening, and for the advice"

Now I have a very busy full-time job at a startup, and it's a ton of fun, but I have less time for side projects.\n\nMy recommendation: Keep putting in the work at Microsoft. The amount of work will ebb and flow. But in the meantime, just tinker on side projects! Build tools that would make your life easier! Try and iterate and monetize. If you can get to $5-10k MRR with some projects then maybe that would be enough to go all in!"

Viewed my time/money as assets. If you're experienced and have good savings then it gives you some freedom from imminent stress. For me - no mortgage, kids, or immigration statuses to worry about. Went into interviews feeling more confident than if those weren't the case (which cannot be understate cause interviewing is about selling yourself). \n\n>-How much networking did you do?\n\nNot much. I tried getting referrals, but didnt work well for me. Even if a lot of jobs are filled by referrals, doesn't mean that a lot of candidates will have success with them. At the end of the day, it's all a numbers game.\n\nI considered going to local tech meetups, but never got around to it. \n\n>-Where do you feel the job market for SWEs is headed?\n\nSo far, upwards trend for hiring mid-level/senior+. I think the market is trying to hire more, but doing so with a slow-steady approach to avoid repeating 2021 hiring spree. Q4 will probably be relatively slow and Q1 of next year will hopefully be relatively good. \n\n>-Any advice for an uncommon strategy that can help job seekers get noticed? A cold outreach strategy? Video cover letters? Publishing an ad for your SWE services in a local newspaper?\n\nNo, tbh I think i just got lucky.\n\nBut maybe try to always consider your audience. Generally the people reviewing your resume is an HM (i.e. tech leaning people manager) and a recruiter (non-technical). If you have contacts that match those description, then get it reviewed by people like that instead of just other engineers.; * 82\n* Just under 3 months from first application to signed written offer\n* Realisitically I don't really feel like I had any sort of edge... if I had to name one thing maybe my communication skills? I make it past HR and EM interviews no problem. I know how to talk and come off as friendly, pleasant to be around, and intelligent. My written communication skills are very strong as well, which makes my resume very good. I see a lot of terrible resumes on this subreddit that people pretend look great and.... that probably helps my chances at the resume stage quite a bit.\n* None.\n* I can't predict the future, and it's not worthwhile trying to. Focus on the now, and what's in your control. When I decided to job hop I didn't think \"Market sucks, if I wait a year maybe it'll be better\". I thought \"I'd like to job hop, let's do this\".\n* Look for companies, don't look for jobs. So many people just troll job boards every day, blindly trusting in their terrible search algorithms. That's not an effective way to job search in my opinion. *Look for companies*. Use each company's careers page to see the entire picture of what they're hiring for, and apply there. I'd be rich of I had a nickel for everytime LinkedIn buried a job post that I was actually qualified for, but on the company's website they had one that was a perfect fit.; **How many applications did you send?**\n\nA little over 1,000.\n\n**How long were you looking for work?**\n\n8 months, although I took a break over the holidays so it's more like 7.5 active months.\n\n**This is the important one: If you feel something in your process gave you an edge, what was it?**\n\nProjects with actual users and/or projects I was paid for. I can't prove that gave me an edge but everything else about my background gave me an anti-edge (I'm self taught and graduated over a decade ago from an average school), but my interview rate was somehow higher than people with formal CS backgrounds.\n\nI also am good at coming up with answers on the fly, which probably helped during interview screens.\n\n**How much networking did you do?**\n\nVery little that amounted to anything.\n\n**Where do you feel the job market for SWEs is headed?**\n\nidk man I'm just a glorified junior\n\n**Any advice for an uncommon strategy that can help job seekers get noticed?

I'm betting it was registered recently.; This is 100% a scam. We see frequently it here and almost daily on /r/Scams. Most likely a fake check scam: From [the wiki](https://old.reddit.com/r/Scams/wiki/index/automoderator#wiki_fake_check) for r/Scams:\n\n\n> The fake check scam arises from many different situations (fake job scams, fake payment scams, etc), but the bottom line is always the same, you receive a check (a digital photo or a physical paper check), you deposit a check (via mobile deposit or via an ATM) and see the money in your account, and then you use the funds to give money to the scammer (usually through gift cards or crypto). Sometimes the scammers will ask you to order things through a site, but that is just another way they get your money.\n> \n> Banks are legally obligated to make money available to you fast, but they can take their time to bounce it. Hence the window of time exploited by the scam. During that window of time the scammer asks you to send money back, because you are under the illusion that the funds cleared.\n> \n> When the check finally bounces, the bank will take the initial deposit back, and any money you sent to the scammer will come out of your own personal funds. Usually the fake check deposit will be reversed in a few weeks, but it can also take several months. If you do not have the funds to cover the amount, your balance will go negative. Your bank will usually charge a fee for depositing a bad check, and your account may be closed depending on the severity of the scam. Here is an article from the FTC: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-and-report-fake-check-scams, and here is an article from the New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/your-money/fake-check-scam.html\n> \n> If you deposited a bad check, we recommend that you notify your bank immediately.; I've gotten several of those... Unfortunately a scam.; One time I had something similar happened to me. The domain on the email checked out, the DKIM signature on the email was good, etc. They even called me to say \"thanks for interviewing, we'd like to offer you the job\".

I may be miserable at an ultra-toxic job, but at least I don't have to worry about my financial stability. Just because you have 8+ months of savings doesn't mean you should *spend* those 8 months of savings to take a risky gamble like this.\n\nI have 10 YOE and it took me about 3 months to get another job. But I also consider myself a very strong candidate, strong interviewer, and strong resume. I still kept my job which I had begun to hate, cause I had no clue how this market would treat me.. But I absolutely *have* seen several anecdotes of people with 10+ YOE on this subreddit that *are* taking a year+ to find other jobs. It's not just for entry level.\n\nSome entry level folks are finding jobs just fine, some aren't. Some 10+ YOE folks are finding jobs just fine, some aren't. Which flavor are you? You can't know until you start applying.\n\nWhat's causing your issues with work? Are you working long hours to compensate for unrealistic deadlines and pressure?\n\nIf so.... Stop. You're not being held at gunpoint, start working 40 hours a week and not *a minute more*. This will alleviate the immediate problem. 9 times out of 10 management won't even notice that you're \"only\" putting in 40 hour weeks. If they do, and don't take it well, it can take months to actually fire someone. And if you actually end up fired? You'll be in exactly the same place as you were planning on putting yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.\n\nThat's what I would do if I were you.; Do you have a mortgage? Do you have a fallback if your savings runs out, like moving in with family? If you have a mortgage and don’t have a fallback I personally wouldn’t risk it. I have more savings than 8 months and have been searching for about 4 months, if you’re anything like me you’ll likely have to go through several more full loops then you have in the past, and that in itself is mentally draining as well. Feels like a full time job trying to compete now.\n\nI don’t have a mortgage and have a fallback so I’m reminding myself not to stress but that would make things different…\n\nIf you have vacation time saved up, now is the time to use it. Don’t talk yourself out of it by saying there is too much work to do.; So this isn't a CS only question. It's relevant to pretty much anyone burned out in most industries. \n\nThere are a lot of variables to keep in mind. Could your current monthly expenditure be paid for by a non-CS job? Could you swallow your pride and work some part time gig somewhere to supplement your expenses? \n\nI've been down the road of poor mental health before. I taught before switching fields, and teaching was incredibly draining. I quit without a backup plan, but I could also support myself doing something for 15 dollars an hour. Sure, I wouldn't be putting in my 401k, but I'd be able to live. \n\nSo that's the question. If you can manage to live on 2k a month, I'd go ahead and quit and take a break. But don't expect to get back into CS quickly. It might be a bit before the market recovers.; I don't think quitting before having a job lined up will help your mental health at all, unless you decide to leave this field for good. Job hunting is probably even more stressful than having a job, especially in this market; I did it a year ago. Took time off and didn't start applying till the last few months. Took me 2.5 months to get an offer I was happy with, which based on comments in this sub is pretty quick. I had enough saved to last me quite awhile longer though. \n\nIf you quit without something lined up then consider tracking your runway and reducing costs wherever you can.\n\nInterviewing does seem to be picking back up for people with experience. I imagine hiring will be slower in Q4 as per usual, and that Q1 of next year will pick it back up again, so consider that when determining your timeline.\n\nMental health is important for sure though. Can you ask for a sabbatical? Or maybe switch teams and see if the onboarding time could be an excuse to do less while you interview/prep? Even with experience though, 8+ months of runway is hard to feel confident about based on what I've seen so far. Hopefully that changes soon though; I did. I couldn't take the bullshit from my manager anymore. He was just awful and managing the team and added unnecessary stress to everyone. I think out of the 12 people on my team, only 3 are left. The rest left for new positions or transfered internally. It really just depends on if you think it's worth it. A person with 10+ years of experience will have an easier time finding work than say someone with 5 years. You also need to take into account how much money you have to live off of. If you can survive without a job for at least a year, it's probably a bad idea.\n\nI quit my job. Ended up taking on 13K worth of debt. I never found another job in the Tech industry. I will say that the time away made me come to feel that there's a lot of stuff in the industry that's just bullshit. Recruiters have no obligation to keep you informed of jobs you applied to through them, companies get away with overworking you without compensation, sometimes companies don't even care to get you \"trained\" into how their code bases and company lifestyles, etc. Some of this could be just me, but it's honestly a very frustrating career. This sub is a testament to a lot of issues people have with this career.\n\nI end up going back into management. I'm happier than I've been in years and am glad I quit. I'd hate to see what I'd be like if I stayed another year. This isn't me saying you should quit your career. I'm more saying that the CS field is rough, and you've just got to find ways to manage your health. I felt my mental health was more important than the money I was making. I make 30k less now, but I'm happy.; One of my former coworkers did this a few months back. She found a job, but was also able to move in with her parents while looking, so her expenses were negligible. 8 months of runway might be enough, but personally, I would keep your job while looking. I’ve had a recruiter or two tell me that it’s easier to find a job while you have one.; Don't, it's not worth it; a former coworker of mine did this in 2021. mid-level, 8 years of experience, quit without a plan for mental health reasons.\n\nhe is still unemployed as of today. i don't know how he is surviving.\n\nanother former coworker of mine was let go for lack of performance due to burn out in 2020. of course they did not say it like this but that was the implication. he had 16 yoe, had lead multi-million dollar projects and done big platform work. he was a solid dev and a solid leader.\n\nhe is still unemployed as of today.; You are better off quiet quitting; I did exactly this, and my mental health got worse before it got better but it did get better.; Go work a labour job. What's stopping you? Some pay far higher than a mundane office job. There is a world outside of a cubicle; If I ran out of money I'd obviously have to. That's not gonna be very good on OP's mental health either, coming to terms with failing so hard at the SWE job search that they had to take a job outside of the industry just to feed themselves.\n\nSurely you understand why working in an unrelated industry isn't helpful for my career, right? SWE is the career I've chosen. The longer I'm not working in the career of my choosing, the harder it becomes to break back into it. The resume gap grows every day.\n\nI understand there's a world outside of a cubicle. If I, or OP, wanted to do that work, we would have pursued that as our careers."

I would focus on something else with more impact like a dog letting out app which would make you stand out. \n\nMake your family/friends your clients. You get instant feedback, which allows you to polish the project from something simple to something complex.\n\nIf I were a student in my last two years, I would focus on polishing a full-stack project. Use GitHub to version files and deploy it (I demoed my deployed project, and they loved it!). \n\nI'm glad my project was a success, and I learned so many things. It even led me to a job xD What I truly didn't expect was the aspect of working with people. I was a solo developer, but I held regular meetings with the client, took feedback from staff seriously, and saw the impact on customer experience. Lol, that was humbling and a big motivator for being in software development.\n\nOn a personal note, keep your testing skills up to date (Don't write test for old code but work on testing your latest codes)! Don't write code mindlessly; program with intention. Regularly ask yourself, \"Why am I using this framework? Why this backend over another?\", \"Is there a better way to do this?\", \"Will this be a problem in the future?\", \"Can I automate this?\" Lastly, have fun. I hope the project you choose is something that means a lot to you so you care about its failures and successes. So, when you talk about this project in interviews, your enthusiasm will show. \n\nI think these tips would help you get internships as well as a job. Good luck!"

If you're an executive and revenue isn't increasing right now, the only way to show shareholders a profit (and get your bonus) is to reduce costs.  Once revenue starts to dip, sell your stocks and move on to the next company.\n\nShort-term thinking did also lead to over-hiring at a lot of companies.  They looked at a short term boost in market demand and assumed that trend would continue, so hired a bunch of people they didn't need.  Some of what's going on now is a correction for that.; No company on the planet wants to have employees. Employees are a necessary evil basically. It is what it is, if you can find a way to reduce cost and put more money in your pocket without impacting revenue, you do it every single time.; It’s a short term solution to drop expenditures (employee salaries) and bump stock price/profits. They’re all doing it at once because it’s been shown to work.; There's a few possible reasons but the main one, in my opinion, is that companies over-hired like crazy during the last few years and are using the excuse of the overblown AI panic to let people who they don't know what to do with go.\n\nI'm cautiously optimistic about what will happen because there's no underlying reason for a large enough pool of talented workers to remain in suspension without consolidating into new companies. It's not like humans are suddenly going to say, \"oh no thank you guys. All my needs and wants have been solved. I'm good without any new technology or devices\".\n\nThat talent pool may need to be larger before it happens than it needed to be a few years ago due to the current interest rates but I think it'll still happen.; Other than big tech is this really true? Startups are still not profitable and are burning money, why the hell would an investor invest in an unprofitable tech company when they can get guaranteed 5% in their bank account?; 2 years ago this sub was all people bragging about working 12 hours a week and making $150k+\n\nNo one should be surprised at this contraction now that the free money supply was turned off.; Because most companies are ran by executives who are obsessed by quarterly reports and layoffs are a quick way of making the numbers look better at least temporarily. Layoffs have negative long term consequences. Brain drain, low moral, and high employee churn rate(people take a hint and leave) are something that companies have to deal with and it rarely is worth it.; Salaries are the biggest expense for most businesses.\n\nSome people aren’t productive enough to remain on payroll, or the projects they’re working on become unprofitable. ; Most of the answers miss a crucial point, which is what has changed. Payrolls have always been a huge expense and so why would this be happening now?   \n  \nThe answer is interest rates. During and before the pandemic credit was cheap, so it was easy to borrow to fund new projects to increase market share or enter new markets. Doing so required hiring a bunch of new employees, but if the growth was large enough then shareholders were on board. With higher interest rates (for various reasons, including leftover snags from the pandemic and the war in Ukraine) the cost to borrow has increased and so companies can no longer justify borrowing in order to grow and instead must improve their appeal to shareholders by increasing their profitability. Tech. was hit especially hard because it tends to have higher demands to grow when credit is cheap, so companies went all in on hiring and starting new projects which they now have to roll back.; This is an overly simplistic view. There are a ton of factors, not limited to the fact that a lot of companies over hired and over paid when the easy money was flowing, companies have decided to not fund some expensive R&D projects, and some are just taking advantage of the surplus of talent on the market. \n\nHiring in 2021 was brutal for companies and now it’s easy. It can make a lot of sense to do layoffs and then rehire cheaper but more skilled employees. The industry is going to continue to be rough for the foreseeable future and probably just get worse.; The overwhelming majority of company profits can be attributed to a small number of people, maybe 5% of employees.  \n\nBut companies will hire as many people as they can IF the expected additional profit from hiring each person is greater than the expected cost.  So if a person costs $100K overall, counting opportunity cost, overhead etc. and produces $101K, that's a good hire, in theory.\n\nA lot of employees are \"on the margin\" because they are working on projects that may or may not be profitable, where the expected return is only slightly above $0.  These employees are not essential to the company, but employing them is seen as slightly better than not employing them.\n\nSmall fluctuations in market conditions, interest rates, tax codes etc. can push large numbers of projects/employees over the edge into \"not profitable\", so they get terminated.  It doesn't mean the company overall is unprofitable, but certain projects within the company might be unprofitable.\n\nAfter a certain threshold, companies tend to layoff everyone on the unprofitable projects, which in the short term causes profits to increase.  This is why record profits often coincide with layoffs.; Companies can overhire beyond their actual needs. When they do this, as many did during COVID, the workload becomes distributed among more people, but productivity is unlikely to scale linearly with the increases in staff.\n\nIdentifying the employees that aren't making as meaningful of a difference can be difficult, and often it's just easier to cull rather than prune, then rehire as needed.\n\nDespite all the bad press that Twitter received when Elon fired most of the company, they are still operating, so how many of those let go were needed? Likely more than were fired but certainly not most of them. This applies to other companies as well.; Cause they don’t need those employees, thus they can increase their margins even more by laying them off. That’s the power of software…; People forget that FAANG execs secretly collaborated to suppress wages years ago. Who says they aren't doing it again. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation\n\nNo conspiracy needed. Great reset indeed.; C. None of the above. Less expense = more profit. More profit = more dividends. More dividends = happy shareholders. It's the bug of public traded companies, infinite growth above all else.; Regardless of the cause, there’s one thing that seems to have changed and is relatively universal now and that is that tech workers are now considered a cost center rather than an asset. Historically, this was only the case in non-tech companies such as insurance/health/banking etc. but not so much anymore. Much like those sectors, you see an increase of offshore/contractor hiring/reduced benefits, and skeleton crews of onshore development to justify the bottom line.\n\nAs soon as a company’s shifts to this opinion you will see reductions in staff regardless of profits. Whether it’s shareholder opinion, layoff hype, day-in-the-life vids, until that sentiment changes the landscape won’t change imo.; A lot of these companies hired in boom times because that’s what investors want you do when capital is abundant. Those employees were definitely not all useful. You can confirm that by just looking at the median engineer’s output at any large company…\n\nNow that efficiency and profit are what investors want, all of the extraneous hires are being laid off. Yes this system definitely sucks for the employees but the US has never had particularly strong worker’s rights 🤷; I make more money than ever, but that wouldn’t stop me from canceling Hulu if I was no longer using it.\n\nCompanies are changing their strategies based on rising interest rates and the AI boom. Projects that seemed like good ideas a few years ago no longer fit into their updated strategy. It doesn’t make sense to keep people employed just because you have the money if you don’t have a plan for how to effectively use them.; Over-hired, rates rose and margins were threatened so they cut peeps. Higher margins now are only because they cut costs. Higher rates and decelerating consumer strength is what portends the econ tanking, and companies are just going with the flow. If you've been out for over a year now, you're done. It's time to dunk fries for you. DEEP, HARD pain is coming in the next 6-12 months. Let's just pray here in tech we already took most of our our lumps when we led the way down.. but recovery won't be for several years.; Worth noting that a lot of these companies are thinning their \\*US\\* workforces. Look up Google or MS's job listings. <1/3 in the US. Lots of listings in Estonia, India, Costa Rica, etc. AI is a threat and I'm sure they're predicting less jobs because of it, but most of the loss is just bc they can get similar talent pools for much cheaper outside the US."

This would include areas like healthcare, various forms of automation, finance/accounting and others. The downside is that the pay/benefits, while usually good, isn't \"TikTok Day in the Life Worthy\" good. You may also need to be in an office/warehouse/factory very frequently.; my stupid ass specialized in computer graphics because i wanted to go into the game industry. i had no idea how hard it would be for me to get into that. i graduated in 2008 when things were pretty bad\n\neverything worked out. i've been in software for 16 years now doing something entirely different from graphics, gainfully employed the whole time\n\nwork hard, do what you like, and you'll be fine; You have the benefit of 3 more years to figure that out.  There are two camps in the gAI field; it’s growth is exponential and it’s growth has plateaued and at best performance will increase linearly every 8 months (same as the hardware cycle) but not quality of output.  If the former is true we’re all screwed, drop out, stop racking up student debt you’ll never pay off and pray to your Congress person for GBI.  If it’s the latter then we will enter a phase of companies building some really cool things with a new technology and most of life will go on.\n\nMy personal benchmark is gpt5, is it a huge step forward or not.  It’s been over a year since gpt4, what’s taking so long?  Have they realized they’ve hit a wall with good trainable data?  Are they holding back because they’ve reached true sentience and are worried about the future of humanity?; It's still a more useful degree than the majority of the degrees offered out there. I've found that what ended up determining my path in life was more about the opportunities available to me, than the direction that I wanted to go. For example, I wanted to pivot into the hard sciences, and in doing so landed on a team where I'm learning ML. Suddenly now I'm more interested in learning more ML than I am about switching to science. When it comes time to apply for your internships, the opportunities you'll get will determine your next step after that, and on and on. The best thing you can do for yourself right now is get good grades, take care of your health, and find enjoyment in what you're learning. Don't forget to have fun in college. It's probably the last time you'll be surrounded by people around your own age, all figuring out who they are together. The self-discovery that can come from that kind of environment is just as important as what you're learning in your classes. Spend this summer figuring out who you are outside of tech, because who you are as a techie is going to be partially determined by things that are outside of your control anyway.; A shaking out of the industry is currently happening amidst a new technology (AI) that no commenter here is going to know where it takes us. The layoffs aren't a gully, it's a changing of the industry in my opinion. Long term, CS people aren't going to be the ones that pay the price though. I would say of all the people currently working in tech, 70% of whom haven't written a line of code in their life and have no idea what tech is actually doing.\n\nTime's have changed. You are more (or less) than the degree you went for in school. You have other skills and interests than just being a code jockey for a reliable (and lets be honest, exceedingly high) paycheck. There is going to be less jobs available over the next 5-10 years where someone does nothing but write code, but it's going to be more valuable to be able to write scripts/query databases/debug code in other positions that SWE positions. It currently is that way. \n\nBusiness admins, customer success, product, sales, marketing, HR are all systems that operate and require data and generally speaking, the people in these positions don't know how to obtain their own data they use, or create infrastructure to regularly supply it. This is work that SWE's would normally get, but doesn't it sound better for a company to hire someone that can do customer success AND configure/maintain a code infrastructure?\n\nLearn multiple skills and you will not be left hungry.; After I read “do I chase money and prestige”, I took a long, hard sigh.;  \nJust do what you enjoy and makes you happy. You’re stressing out because you’re getting confused by stuff you read online but it seems you don’t even know why you picked this or maybe you know but it’s for mundane reasons like money and stability, and in the current year things in general aren’t looking good.\n\nMoney? Stability? Not so much these days but CS careers benefit a lot when switching companies more than the average job but if you notice in these subs the people that are good in their fields tend to be really chill in those areas.; Get off Reddit. Understand that most of the doom posters are people that lost big tech jobs paying absurd salaries. There are still plenty of jobs out there paying good wages. Will you be able to buy a yacht, Ferrari, and private plane? No, but you will make more than most American households are making combined.; I'm so thankful that I didn't know this subreddit existed when I was in college. I'm also thankful I wasn't doom-googling to see what to major in, what career to pursue, etc. All I used reddit for back then was to watch funny videos.\n\nI liked computers growing up. My Uncle taught me some basic HTML and I thought it was awesome being able to create things from nothing. I decided to major in CS because I liked computers, just like someone who likes painting might major in art, or someone who likes working on old cars might pursue being a mechanic. I wasn't thinking of anything besides \"I like computers, CS sounds fun\" at this point.\n\nWhen I was looking for internships, and new grad jobs, I wasn't hyper-focused on a specialty. I wasn't trend chasing, or money chasing, or prestige chasing. I wasn't even ***aware*** of the trends, nor did I care. I applied to what job postings there were, and what sounded interesting. I went to career fair boths at random to learn what was out there and hear it first hand. I applied to lots of different things, and accepted whatever I could get.\n\nOne of my internships wasn't even SWE, it was a PM internship. While I had a lot of fun... that internship taught me PM wasn't for me. In another universe I loved that internship and oriented my entire career around it. Nothing against PM, lots of people love it, and a CS degree qualifies you for it. That's just something I learned through doing. Googling \"Is PM for me?\" would not have given me the same kind of answer.\n\nAsk youself what ***you*** want. Not what reddit or the internet says is good, or right, or stable. Don't read any of that conflicting advice online.\n\nReddit can help guide you towards a goal you've already established for yourself, but don't let reddit set the goal itself.; The entire white collar job market seems to be in the toilet now for new grads no matter what you pick. Tech is kind of an exaggeration of the state of the overall economy (really good when it's good, really bad when it's bad).\n\nThe recent \"hot jobs\" of AI, data science, and cyber security aren't entry level positions anyway.\n\nWithout being able to predict the future, I'd say make sure you focus on your more broadly applicable CS classes, while testing out and exploring different specializations on your own. After you've had time to try different things, start focusing on what actually interests and engages you (picking from things that are realistic options though, not something like fax machines or Adobe Flash); Maybe all the doom posting is actually AI's trying to scare you into quitting so they can take your job instead.; If it makes you happy, just know that half the people in tech are literal tards. And still AI will not replace them anytime soon; Here are my two cents. I have been in the game a while.\n\nI think the current AI craze will burn itself out. I think Model Collapse is going to stop some of the biggest ambitions. this doesn't mean something new and interesting won't eventuslly overcome the issue but Generative AI is only as good as its best inputs.\n\nMore seriously, every few years, the end of software dev is heralded but has yet to materialize. We are unique in being the only industry actively trying to eradicate the on-ramp for our future successors though. \n\nIf you want to pick something thst seems somewhat safe fkr the foreseeable future, get into security. All this AI code combined with old libraries, the common patchwork of systems and legacy critical infrastructure is a nightmare in the making. Look at the number of regular and high profile failures that keep happening. This is a place you're likely to see work for quite some time but it can be brutal.; The days of great job security are over for nearly every career that isn't healthcare. Period. So stop worrying about making the \"perfect\" choice.; AI is just a buzzword for non tech companies. You probably won't even be checked on CV/NLP knowledge, unless the position is specifically for postgrad candidates.; the fact that you're even worrying about this stuff a year into college puts you ahead of 80% of your competition.; I feel you bro, I am in the same boat. I know people will just say I suck but I mostly just feel lost\n\n  \nEdit: at least you aren't a new grad in this market lol; I currently work in software, but my degree is in photography. I graduated in 95, just as digital was becoming a real thing. We all had to learn to adapt to the new technology. Some jobs were almost eliminated like photo lab tech, others changed, and yet others grew as the new technology became more widely used. \n\n\nAI and other new tools are the same in software, in that they will impact our careers, the degree of impact will depend on you and your willingness to learn new things. Some jobs like mine in QA are likely some of the first to be impacted, since so many companies already see us as overhead rather than valued assets. Nobody has a crystal ball, but being able to embrace change and learn new technologies is something that is going to be a feature of your career pretty much forever.; >I really need some career guidance right now\n\nWhy should any internet strangers give you career guidance?  You have resources at school, they are paid to help students."

   "Top Comments": "Someone might have better advice as this is something I just started looking into. But from the research I’ve done, I’d say contact a recruiter or hiring manager and shoot them a polite email or LinkedIn message asking about a coffee chat, in person or virtually. And if you can’t contact them via LinkedIn, use hunter.io to find their email to reach out.\n\nIt wouldn’t hurt to contact current software engineers at the company as well and do the same. Employees get kickbacks for referrals so if you can get chummy with them they’d have incentive to refer you.\n\nAs far as what to talk about, I planned on asking about their journey into their role/industry, how you can make yourself more marketable, and I guess if you can find a good time maybe even mention open/upcoming opportunities. But that could be a given based on how you present yourself anyway.\n\nI highly recommend your idea btw, try and network as much as you can. I personally know of 3 people who’ve done similar and all landed jobs in the past year by networking / cold calling, even in this shit market ; [removed]; You should use any median you can to get ahold of someone. Write up a simple email asking if they have any openings on their team and if they would like your resume. \n\nSchedule coffee chats if you can.

   "Top Comments": "Would you be an ass? No absolutely not. Make your manager aware of the theft, and if no action is taken, make HR aware. You believe you're entitled to credit because it contributes to an overall performance goal you've set out to attain for the company. Demonstrating concentration on the company's bottomline and wellbeing goes a long ways. Exposing someone who fraudulently labels work as their own could also help the company's bottomline as this individual could land the company in hot water should they rip off the wrong code.; Here is EXACTLY what you should do:\n\nGo to your boss and say “hey coworker X found my code to be a very useful reference for addressing a similar problem in a different application our company offers. Can we allocate time to standardizing my code and offering it as a library in future applications to avoid repeat work? I would love to lead this initiative! :)” Include coworker X in the email. They’re not going to argue with you about that. You’ll look good. You’ll look like a leader. Your boss will be impressed.; Did your stuff work? Was the other person fixing something?\n\nIt’s a job, bunch of people work and overwrite and update same codebase, which the company owns.; Do you not commit your code via some form of source control? Kind of hard to steal someone’s work when there is a timestamped record of proof with your username attached…. How did they “steal” your work?; so, a couple things. First.. \n\n> my work at my job from within the company that I have done and can prove that it was mine\n\nIt's a hard lesson to hear, but unfortunately you're mistaken about this. It's not your work, it never was. It's the company's work. It doesn't belong to you, and it never did. You just so happen to have been the person who worked on most recently. You won't be taking it with you when you leave, and the company is free to do with it whatever it pleases.\n\nSo, if they took some module you wrote (or something), and copied into their project, that's probably a perfectly acceptable thing to have done. You aren't owed credit. Yes, excessive copypasta can become a technical issue, but that's not the topic of discussion here. In this case, the act itself was legitimate.\n\nThat being said, if the person is claiming to have done the job you did - e.g. \"I fixed this bug\" when in fact you were the one who put the work in, that's more of an issue. In those cases, I'd simply speak to your (your, not their) manager, let them know someone else is claiming to have done the same work you accomplished, and let them deal with it. What matters to you is that your management chain recognizes the actual work product you put forth.\n\nSorry homie, when you work for a business, you're working _for_ the business. If you want to claim ownership, found your own company, and/or start a public open source project.; First of all if you’re working for an organization you never own the code. The code belongs to the company. But if you feel someone stole your work as it is and didn’t give you the credit, then thats where git comes to the rescue. Get the screenshots of your PR and their PR and raise it to the relevant person.; if he is not someone familiar with you just fk him in the ass , think twice i he is your team leader or manager xD; [removed]; [removed]; What kind of work? Was it written? A document? If so, threaten with a suit for copyright infringement lawsuit.; Talk to your manager; What kind of \"work\" are you referring to? Did you write up a document and they are trying to pass it off as their own? Did you write some code and they are claiming they wrote it? There's not enough information here to know what happen. You should update your post with more details.; A lot of people in our industry, unfortunately, don't care about proper attribution of ideas, or worse, actively sabotage such.  Speak up for yourself, I think people will respect you more for standing up (as long as you do it appropriately).; You could talk to the person and ask to have your name put above theirs. Also claim credit harder; Also steal his credit (of he got extra work off the success of your work steal that extra back!) welcome to life don't forget we were tribal cavemen once.; If you work for a company, there is no such thing \"my work\". Actually, all my managers I had so far would have handled this situation by saying something along these lines:\"Guys, the goal is to deliver the product to customer, need to focus more in QA now.... but in any case, credits go to the entire team, not to just a few individuals.\"\n\nTherefore, play it professionally, don't start wars, keep your cards closer next time. All managers care just for the moment, expected product delivery, less noise and smooth team running. No one gives a s#it who did the code. In case you make this a big deal, you will see they will play theater with you, pretending they care and make a compromise. In their closed doors, they will flag you as a trouble maker. \n\nMove on, play it professionally.; No, do it!; Not only that they threw me under the bus saying my stuff doesn’t work because they couldn’t get the ssl to work. Which I admit took some troubleshooting to fix on a customer install. But they basically commented out using of ssl which is a requirement then they put their name on top of my work and said they fixed it and my stuff didn’t work. ; Plot twist: the “someone” is the manager 😂; HR is not the police."

That's kinda the whole point of gambling. Slots and online games *obviously* aren't in your favor, just like physical table games aren't in your favor. Casinos would not exist if that weren't the case.\n\nWhat matters is that the odds in the codebase or in the games match the odds published by the casino, or abide by whatever local laws require regarding payout percentages.\n\nThat being said, gambling is heavily regulated.; I wish the same regulations were applied to video games. The \"random number generator\" in angry birds 2 is anything but, and a remarkably good backgammon game was remarkable because it actually used rolls to guess the RNG seed then clobber you as it knew what was coming.; The casino already has an advantage to begin with.

   "Title": "Does it matter if I go to a top 30 school or a top 100 school for CS grad?",
   "Top Comments": "It helps, a better university has higher performing peers, better labs/clubs, more stuff going on campus, better internship opportunities, and you tend to learn more. But once you have a few years of industry experience it doesn't matter anymore and will not necessarily limit your career. At 5 years in nobody really cares about your undergrad anymore. If you can get into the higher ranked school I would, but I wouldn't go into large amounts of debt to do so.\n\nFWIW I've worked at two of the FAANGs and had people who managed to work there way up without even going to college, people who had a 4 year degree, and people who went to top tier CS schools and they all had the same job.; Grads from top schools definitely earn more than average. They likely also get more callbacks from top companies.\n\nBut, it's hard to tease out how much is correlation vs causation. Ie do top schools cause top students or do top students go to top schools? Would a top student at a top school have done just as well going to a community college?\n\nI think it's a lot more pressure to make roi if you go to a top expensive school. And you can definitely still end up in a top company even at a no name school as long as you perform well in interviews.; There’s a lot of conflicting data on this, but basically your question is: “does going to a school with a lower admission rate increase student outcome?”\n\nThe classic answer to this is “no”, since it’s the students themselves, their parents, and families that result in students going to more successful school being more likely to get high paid jobs anyway. This is the basis for the advice, “it doesn’t matter where you go, but how well you do there”\n\nThat does make a lot of sense, the majority of talent is outside of top schools anyway, just based off numbers, and there are additional factors: like adding debt load.\n\nHowever, you should make sure you go to a school with good CS research, and participate by working with professors who are doing it. That will give you a differential advantage in learning through exposure, and be the upper limit on what you can learn.\n\nStill, going to CS feeder schools is a slight advantage, through connections and hiring opportunities on campus. However; a brilliant student, in a CS research department, will go as far as their skills can take them, no matter the rank.; For the first few years out of school, it does matter a bit. The opportunities and the network afforded to a top school alum is really good. You should see what kind of companies recruit at MIT and Stanford career fairs. It's precisely the type of companies that people here drool over.\n\nAlso, if you want to be a founder eventually, graduates from top schools have an easier time getting VC money.; You should check to see the connection opportunities with each school. For example when I'm on Linkedin, it'll show me how many alumni from my university work at the company. The more the better cause it means the more likely the peers you befriend will get those opportunities, which means potential referrals.\n\nFor example, my TAs would get FAANG internships and I was pretty tight with them during office hours. If i were smarter, I'd have leveraged them more for referrals. So basically, look for whether the top 30 school provides better networking, but otherwise probably won't make too much of a difference.; Yes, don’t listen to others that tell you otherwise. I went to a shit tier university and worked at a shit tier company until I got my foot in the door and got some experience.\n\nCapital One for example only targets specific universities and working here fresh out of school is pretty hard unless you’re exceptional(not even like c1 is prestigious).; A lot of people here are saying it will help like its definite but it will only help you out if you put in the effort to learn outside of class. Back when I was working in big tech I can't even count on both hands how many people from top schools such as Harvard, Carnegie Mellon, etc.. that we interviewed who were unable to navigate the CLI or knew how a compiler or OS worked at a deeper level. While people from smaller schools we interviewed seemed to know all this stuff no problem. So I guess going to a big school can help you land a job interview but that's it. If you don't spend a lot of time understanding things at a deeper level then youll fail your interview.\n\nPart of the reason why i probably saw more of this from reputable schools was because we just interviewed any new grad who had Harvard on their resume vs our leadership being more picky with people from smaller schools.\n\nAnyways long story short; you get out of school the amount of effort you put into it. If you go to a smaller school and study your ass off, spend time learning outside of class, and build connections with people then I don't think you'll have an issue finding a job. Even in big tech.; Honestly the only thing that top schools do now days is give you a better shot at internships and first job. Don’t underestimate how valuable that can be especially in a rough market like right now.\n\nIf one is significantly more affordable it’s probably worth it.; Pick the one you can do with the least debt; I would like to add that you should be sensitive to national rankings as well and not only CS rankings. \n\nAlso, a lot of non-ranked liberal arts colleges are also highly regarded like Harvey Mudd. \n\nMany will hate me for saying this, but selectivity (admission rate) is often better indicator of “prestige” than rankings.\n\nNow if it’s a legit rank 100 university (not liberal arts, not highly ranked in non-CS) vs a rank 30 university, then yes the rank will matter.; I came out of a top 5 and I can tell you that the biggest difference I saw from other schools is the presence of companies at the school. Top schools usually have more recruiters around campus, they sponsor more hackathons, sometimes they even have their research facilities within the university. If you’re involved and network it shouldn’t be that hard to come out with some job leads if not offers. After the first couple of years, education doesn’t seem to matter. I can’t remember the last time I’ve been asked or cared about where someone came from during interviews.; Going to a better school also gives you networking opportunities with classmates that may go on greater things, which in turn could give you better opportunities from knowing such people. Networking is one of the best things you can do in college and in your career.; Rankings exist for a reason. Top 30 and top 100 is a big difference. Higher ranked schools attract brighter talent, which attracts more career opportunities. \n\nAlthough if this is for grad school it may not make a huge difference. Rankings matter more for undergrad; No; It doesn’t matter at all save for a few local examples (Stanford has a leg up on the west coast).  As long as people have heard of the school and it’s not BumFuck community college, then it’s all the same.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don’t care if it’s BumFuck community college, BumFuck boot camp, or you taught yourself.  Do I want to work with you everyday and do I think you’ll do a good job?; Yes, it matters a lot. And actually continues to matter well into your career if you want to stay at the top of the field (big tech, quant, top startups etc.).; Everyone commenting here saying that it matters is leaving off an important qualifier: do you want to work at FAANG/prestigious companies? If not, then it matters way less. Sure, going to CMU is going to open a few more doors for you, but there are thousands of companies out there that just want a graduate with a decent GPA. If going to a top tier school is going to put you in massive debt or doesn't feel like it'll be the experience you want, or you don't care about aiming for the very top of the industry, a top 100 school is likely more than enough.; Of course it does, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\n\nCall me crazy but Mississippi State is nowhere near as good of a CS program as say UC Berkeley.; You want the no-BS answer in today's day and age? Yes, it matters. I go to a non-MIT, non-Harvard school in Boston, it's been so much of pain in the ass trying to get cold call callbacks. Same for all my friends, except one, who got one random callback and now works there. These aren't bottom ranked schools, but they're not top either. Hiring managers are dumb, similar brain intelligence as plankton, you have to play with them. It's like going to a worse off school, doing great projects etc. and then applying to jobs is similar to playing chess with a child - they don't understand the game. Go to the highest ranked school you can unless the price is too high (basically 1.5-2x). Don't skimp because of  10-20K difference.; Unless you have aspirations for those massive paying roles in big tech, I recommend going to a smaller school where you can thrive and be at the top of your class. That’s what I did."

I don't live in Europe so I don't know. I know it is popular for some legacy apps written in 2005-2012.\n\nBut I have not seen it used in Silicon Valley, big tech or California coastal cities start-ups. And I've been around the block. Big tech and startup is what is hiring in volume so you will see more Node/Python/Go job ads. Don't believe me? Just look on indeed or glassdoor and search PHP dev vs MEAN / MERN stack. So that is what I see. Now, if I was in Bulgaria and looked up the job board there, it may be entirely different.; > I work in a small company where things like Laravel and Drupal are seen as the gold standard of web development.\n\nGet job at bigger companies that do web scale.; Overcrowded, most company / custoners already have their cheap developers ...; The best candidates don't necessarily have it in their skillet anymore. For the top companies who use PHP heavily still (like Meta), they feel better about hiring the best people and giving them great resources to learn the skills they need to contribute. That's the only thing you can do at scale these days; Laravel is an excellent framework for building applications. The concepts are all common across various frameworks, and PHP is continuously improving as a language.\n\nI just typed Laravel in LinkedIn jobs and got tons of results all posted in the past 2 days.\n\nUltimately, it's good to learn other languages and frameworks. But there's lots of jobs in PHP.; they might say \"CMS\"; I worked in PHP for 7 yrs now switched to Nodejs and Python. I think PHP is still behind in term if providing all the modern tools so i think the community is very limited.; This is one of those answers that's \"technically\" true, but in reality it's misleading in the context of job opportunities using PHP.\n\nYes, Wordpress is by far still the lions share of production PHP running on the web, but it's far from the standard choice in modern software companies still leveraging PHP. You won't find as many startups running on PHP because it's not \"hip\", but you'll find plenty of mature companies running at scale on modern frameworks like Laravel/Symfony.\n\nMy first job was working on a PHP stack for a site that handled hundreds of millions of monthly active users, from personal experience PHP had no negative impact on my career.; Username checks out; Yeah, I'm not worried about being able to pick up a new language - heck, I'm learning PHP on the job here.  I only knew JavaScript before.  But what about getting hired?  Am I going to get automatically filtered out if I don't tick their boxes?; It’s definitely easier, comparatively, to start working, but simply put you will just not be as productive as people who have been working in the other language’s ecosystem for a long time, thus making it harder to get the job in theory. ; bastardized C / Perl / PHP\n\nWas the code base whispering - Kill me?; I'm definitely flexible and eager to learn, but the problem is with getting hired for my next job.\n\nOne person here even agreed that I should remove PHP and Drupal from my resume to get another job.  How do I feel like I'm not sliding backwards in my career, and apply to jobs with modern stacks?  How did you go from LAMP to C#, for example?  Are times just different now?; Lol so am I hurting my career by getting the only kind of experience I can?  Should I delete PHP and Drupal from my resume and pretend it's all JavaScript?; Yeah Europe is usually several years behind"

   "Top Comments": "Also worth noting, I should've studied EE in undergrad lol. CS was not worth it since anyone can just study EE or CE and end up getting the same job.; Either do a PhD in machine learning/ai or robotics (since they're the most lucrative now) or it's just learning for your own sake. It has no bearing on your ability to do side projects that will get you the job in whatever specialty you care about. Master's is just a way to buy time basically. Hopefully, your company will pay for it.; Me personally won’t do it. Because I think school is waste of money.; I went EE -> SWE route. IMHO the other way around is much harder. If you seriously want to become an electrical engineer, you probably need to go to a real school. Depending on your specialty, it might be just impossible to self taught. There are plenty of free resources to learn, if you are interested in stuffs like signal processing, circuits, control systems. But if you are looking at stuff like VLSI, solid state physics, semiconductor photonics , especially if you want a career in them, instead of just know about what they are, you’ll be better off to go back to school; Weird, I’m the exact opposite. I majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering and wished I had just done CS instead.; Tbh I came from an electrician background and the only thing I could really say that interests me about electrical engineering a bit is the signal processing and embedded work. Chose to study CS instead of EE largely because I kinda wanted to get out of the electrical industry lol. Do you have any advice for seeking and training for those areas of work (non-construction related preferably)?; Why CS. There's an abundance of oversaturation of material on the Internet that it seems useless to get a CS degree.\n\nYou did the perfect thing getting EE; I’ve no idea about electricians😂My specialty was semiconductor photonic circuit design. TBH the majority of EE industry isn’t much different from software if neither interests you. Mostly you sit in front of a computer all day  and solve problems.; There are not that many good jobs that require an EE. Sure there are lots of CS grads but there are also very few good true EE jobs that don’t require a PhD in EE; Ah OK. Most opportunities in my country are in the construction field unfortunately and it's really unfortunate that the electronics side of it is still pretty dead. I think it would be good to look at in the future if they ever bring electronics back though. As it stands right now though, not too sure. I've only really had electronics with control circuits and AC with DC theory training at TAFE lol which I had to do as part of the electrician work, and that is probably nowhere near in depth as an EE degree would go. Would like to have more experience with the lower level electronics though. Hoping to try and get more of an idea regarding signal processing stuff as well, but I'm currently trying to get myself fairly solid with Calc II and the higher parts of linear algebra first before going into signals and systems with DSP later on."

You sound unhinged.\n\nEDIT: Some massive red flags to me: \n\n* after you complain about a psychopathic OCD boss (if these are the words you used in a professional environment, you got fired for harassment dude)\n* Firing someone 2 weeks on the job because they aren't coding on day 1 and not completing 85 use cases (so you're 2 weeks on the job before getting fired, but it's over your day 1 performance? Really, *85* use cases?)\n* Firing someone so they could use you as a scapegoat (lol)\n* \"doesn't understand the roadblocks of their own business\", \"if you're 5mins late to a 7am meeting\" (so you come into a job as a know-it-all, admit to being late, hmmm)\n* \"caste-loving Amazon-type manager\", \"if you show signs of medical illness\" (lmao obvious racism aside, what signs of 'medical illness' are we talking here? Anything that would hinder your job should have been disclosed during the hiring process under ADA, or are we self-diagnosing your crazy? Because you'd have a nice fat lawsuit on your hands otherwise); Based on your profile, you do overemployment. Maybe that was a huge factor?

Stock is how you get rich, not J2; Ok; You are on r/overemployed talking about having 3 parallell jobs. Here you talk about being fired 5 times, and nothing in your post indicates that you are to blame for any of them. Where is the proof from your 2 last jobs?

The company got in financial trouble and fired 1/3 of their staff. They asked me to come back 2 weeks later\n2. WLB was hell, they did me a favour by firing me\n3. The startup sold to the very first bidder who proceeded to fire every employee immediately\n\nBut now I'm at a company that sees my ability to ramp up quickly and my varied experiences as a superpower.

Each time it felt like it wasn't caused by me ducking around. I've been a contractor and that caused me to be easy to let go. Plus one time I've been assigned to frontend work while explicitly saying i don't like / don't know frontend. It happens and I've had a few projects that proved me to be a valuable team member, it's just that each team is different; **I have to agree with posts here after reading your post history**\n\nAnd look, you can indeed just be unlucky, but my experience tells me you are spreading yourself thin  and you think no one is catching up. If someone is going out of their way to monitor your day to day work history it could be they caught onto your lack of performance. \n\n**I'll give you some perspective**\n\nMy job is to mentor more junior engineers so they develop professionally. Last year we *let go* of  one of those engineers because of underperformance. From his view it was a *toxic* environment and micromanagement, but this is how it played out:\n\n* He started to miss a lot of meetings or be late to them.\n* We allow some WFH and there were days where he was completely unaccounted for and it became normal for people to not know what he was up to.\n* He would spend long periods of time on very simple tasks that should not have taken him as long. I am sure he got away with stretching timelines more than once, but we eventually caught on.\n* Whenever he needed my help the amount of code he had written in 2 weeks was what I would expect someone of his level to write in two days.\n* The biggest giveaways were the meeting updates where he basically gave the same update day after day until like two weeks had passed. He probably didn't even notice he had told the team exactly the same thing for so long.\n* I caught on quickly to this, but my job is to mentor him, to keep him *employed*, but eventually other senior engineers and managers caught on as well.\n* At that point people started to monitor his day to day activity, his Jira history, his commit history. The facade was over.\n* Managers started to get more critical of him especially when he missed meetings or soft deadlines.\n* By the time he was actually trying, it was too late, too long had passed and management plus HR were already planning his exist.\n\nWhen I read your other posts especially posts where you acknowledge you are spread thin, it definitely gives me the same feeling I had when trying to help the above guy. I think **you think that you are too clever** and that no one has caught on to your game. But from my view experience and your posts talking about others checking over your day to day work, it seems like they have.; I'm glad you're happy.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest you consider is if it's worth risking your happiness at these good jobs by doing over-employment. Most companies would fire you over that if they found out.\n\nThat aside, I'd be curious to hear about how much time you spent on the reverse interview for those first 5 jobs? Most of the causes for your firing you listed sound like things that would pop up pretty quickly in the reverse interview.\n\nUnrealistic expectations for example, expecting you to code on day 1. The expectations of your hiring manager should be something you start talking about *during the interview*. I'm starting a new job in June, and I know *exactly* what's expected of me, what onboarding looks like, etc. That's part of why I accepted the offer. If their expectations were too high (or too low), I would've declined, because culture/WLB is important to me. Talking to the SWE's I get an understanding about the team culture, how much they work together, challenges, pain points, etc.\n\nThere's a *lot* of shitty companies/teams out there. If you aren't reverse interviewing, that means you're just rolling the dice. There's a good chance you end up on those teams. So if you're not doing that, that also means you landed at these last 2 \"good\" jobs entirely by luck.\n\nDon't leave something like your career/happiness up to luck. The only scenario you listed that sounded like you wouldn't be able to suss out in a reverse interview is the last one where a new manager came in and changed everything.; What you’ve explained could have been the case, OP. That you were really unlucky and are the pristine worker you claim to be. This scenario would be very unlikely but I have no way of knowing. \n\nSo let’s just assume your assessment is correct and you had five instances where you were done dirty.  How can you not be more introspective about things that YOU could do to avoid this in the future?  Even if you had this insanely unlucky streak, it floors me you wouldn’t be thinking of how you can adjust your approach, which is the one thing you can control.  Instead you just write it off as “they’re all crazy and I’m the model worker”. It’s not a zero sum game - you can be fired from a job for little or no cause, but at the same time do some personal reflection and identify some areas to improve on to avoid that situation again. \n\nBeing accountable is a wonderful trait.  Having no accountability is the trait I see most people get fired for.; OP have you ever discussed your cases with an Employment lawyer? Or at the very least reported your last employer to the labor dept in your state \\[I am assuming you are in the USA\\], sounds like the state could investigate your last employer for discriminatory business practices.\n\n  \nOther people in the comments: Depending on OP's case for his last employer if he has documented everything, he can take this for a slam dunk lawsuit against last employer. OP has possibly mentioned possible discriminatory business practices."

If for no other reason than the fact $75k might be tight depending on what kind of lifestyle you want to live in CA.\n\n>if I ask and they say no, then they know I wanna move, which would cause issues\n\nThe way I suggest approaching these conversations is treating them like *conversations*. Don't walk into a room and ask if you can go remote. Don't tell your manager you've decided to move to California.\n\nInstead, in your next 1/1, simply bring it up *conversationally*.

Hiring is hard. Could be months before they're ready to replace you, hopefully you should be able to line up a job before that happens. But unless your manager is no the toxic side, I doubt an adult conversation about your future would immediately put them into \"gotta place Datchole\" mode.; People who get exceptions\n\nCompany culture, leadership is lax and allows most requests\n\nKey resources the company doesn't have a back up for \n\nTemporary exceptions for life issues; Does the company already have employees/offices in California?

I got permission to go remote (out of country) months in advance and got VP approval. A week before we fly out after selling our cars and choosing not to sign a lease on our apartment, I got laid off along with a few others.\n\nI had also already rejected a different offer as my company said I could keep my salary which would go quite far in the new country I was moving to.\n\nI get that I was the obvious choice but it really sucked at the time.; True. Definitely need a backup.; I can add another personal anecdote here, it happens even in red hot markets.\n\nAt my last company one of my co-workers moved across the country since his wife got a job there. Our company was officially hybrid, but we had a handful of exceptions for fully remote works, and our manager didn't want to lose him so made an exception for him as well.\n\nGuess who the first folks up for layoffs were when we acquired a new product and had to cut some redundencies."

Has her own business too. I love her, but she makes me question if encountering poverty for her sake is worth it. I still have to spend money on dinners, hotels, etc. And she kept complaining to me about my last job which was high paying. I turned down a job offer in February so that I could spend more time with her. But, she used to get offended when I would apply to jobs instead of spend time with her. But, she stopped being that way. She realized how extremely important it is.\n\nMy fiancé is in another country, by the way. Actually, since losing my last job, I haven't been in the US. My last job I only lasted a couple of months, because my mom died. Long story, she died right before starting the job. It was government-related so I couldn't work remotely overseas like my job before that one. The job offer which I turned down was also government. Now it seems like government isn't hiring people at the moment.; u/ThunderChaser ,  \n  \nShe told me that money wasn't necessary to her, but I had to keep spending money on things for her.  Then she got mad that I wasn't paying attention to her when I applied for work, so I mentioned how I kept spending money on her and needed to find work.  Then she got offended, saying that I'm a man and supposed to do that.  Then she said she's embarrassed to ask her brothers about what I said, and they always pay for their girlfriends.  But, it's like:  \n1) they all have jobs  \n2) they work for her dad. \n\nI only brought up paying for things because I have no income, and if I keep going out to restaurants every day and on trips every weekend, I will eventually run out of money.  \n\nAnother challenge we face is the cultural difference in our views on money. My fiance, in her 30's and financially independent, is not eager to share her wealth.  She seemed to reconsider when I mentioned this to her dad, who emphasized love over money until I mentioned how she could be the breadwinner and I stay at home.  The reality is that they still expect me to support her financially, which I am okay with doing, but seriously, they try to help me accomplish that by not giving me a hard time that I am working or ever applying for work.\n\nShe also strongly opposed moving to the US. She would have preferred that I stay in her country instead, and I tried to find a way to do that but failed.  However, if my partner were in her 20s, she might not have a business that she feels she can't let go of. She might also be more open to the idea of moving to the US for our relationship.  \n\nBut my mom saw her photo, and she liked her before she died (she died on the day that I proposed, and I almost didn't go through with it, but I caved in when I got the news that my mom passed away).  Also, she seems to really really like me.  It is pleasant to be with someone who really cares about you, and they're more willing to tolerate your flaws than maybe most people.  So, she has those two things going for her.  \n\nu/destructiveCreeper is only echoing the very thought that I runs through my mind.  \n\nFor the three months spent with her, I wanted to leave multiple times and go back to Poland to get my ADHD medicine. But, being insecure, she kept threatening to break up with me every time I wanted to leave her.  And, she has reason to be, to be fair, I was talking to other women.  \n\nIt wasn't until I finally overstayed my visa that she was okay with me leaving without the threat of a breakup. She's coming to Poland to see me now.  I will probably spend one final weekend with her before flying back to the US.  I might have to try to see if I can do in-person interviews to maintain some competitive edge.  \n\nRight now, there is a job gap of 3 to 4 months. I keep thinking back to how I rejected a job offer that would have made me come back to the US in February, but it would probably have been worth it since it was WFH at least. Now, I am looking at jobs that will not only require that I come into the office, but I will probably take a HUGE pay cut from when I met her or from the job that she kept complaining to me about.  Not to mention, I am currently in debt which I can pay off with my stocks and assets, but I was saving up these things to buy a house one day.\n\nI really should have maintained a better frame and made sure that she aligned with me. Even if they're older and have their own businesses, they still expect a lot from you.; You realize being outside the US will make your job search much harder than having a beard will?"

   "Top Comments": "Depends how small. I’ve been working on computer vision deep learning models on stm32, it’s tough but it’s working. Mostly tensorflow and python to build the models then they’re converted to C. Flash and RAM sizes are tough and severely limiting but we’re getting it to work. ; Not sure I’m grasping the concept here… loading pretrained models into ARM? Is this really embedded? Sounds more like running them on a raspi which doesn’t seem novel at all. \n\nAnd to what ends? Is this your issue, identifying a problem for a solution you’ve already set your sights on? \n\nMaybe look at problems faced in embedded systems applications: edge device human-computer interaction, “real time” applications for AI like manufacturing robot online predictive calibration (see Machina Labs), US Air Force AI/terminator jets that kill people automatically…\n\nHell, make a racing drone that flies itself or a digital waifu bot that can communicate through audio with LLM backing and no internet access. I’d dunno. Make a robot arm that uses CV and other AI based task management to knoll the items on my desk. \n\nBut still, I’d think the real meat is developing purpose built embedded solutions using these models “burned in” as it were rather than riding on top of some layers of micro SoC firmware/OS/Repl or whatever. Basically get the models running closer to metal.; Well, I think this is the most common approach to the topic. Did you use STM32 X-Cube-AI for the python -> C conversion?; I get your point, thank you.\n\nWell, in one case (motor control) the idea is first to create and train a model, and only after to implement it. The novel here should be the model itself, even though also the idea behind is cool, since the use of an AI for that specific control is something only an American start-up has produced yet. \n\nRegarding the other, I have to say I'm not sure yet. Benchmarking the performance of some tiny model on some hardware (STM32, because the guy offering it works for STmicroelectronics) is certainly not enough to cover a 6-9 months internship, but this proposal just came out during our last meeting and we still have to enter the details.\n\nAnyway, the topics you've mentioned are what I would like to work with in the future. And it really seems like a very challenging but promising field.; Not yet but we replicate some of their pipeline with open source stuff. We use the zephyr RTOS so it would defeat the point kinda to use stm’s tools, but theirs have been promising for general usage. \n\nTensorflow can handle that process on its own but the documentation is an absolute nightmare, all the good features are experimental and “may change at any point” and the critical parts haven’t been updated in 3-5yrs so google colab can’t run the samples provided. We’re trying to do improvements and PRs as we go but it’s such a large code base with an even bigger conceptual aspect. ; I think there are cool applications. Just seemed like you had solutions looking for problems. \n\nI think rendering down the applications for small commodity hardware for consumer grade home robotics is most interesting, personally. Like my desk sorting robot idea. Plenty of big manufacturing tech does this, but nothing yet that I can install in my house to clean up after me. Partly to do with size, but also compute tech. That’s where cheap embedded comes into play. "

Before the first ring is complete the person calling ended their call…. (literally rang for like 3 seconds) I tried calling back and went to voicemail.\n\nLike wtf is that, they don’t even have the decency to tell me they went with someone else or cancelled the interview??? \n\nHow do you get a job if you can’t even get an interview?; At the beginning of my career, I did some freelancing even before starting college. I easily got an internship and after a year and a half, I got a job as a Junior Software Engineer at an international company. It was my first time speaking English with people; before, I only practiced by myself and by watching TV shows and things in English.\n\nAlmost at the same time, about a month after I left the company where I was an intern, one of my superiors who really liked my work invited me to do some freelancing for him. He wanted to develop a SaaS. After a few months, he asked me to become a partner in the company, and he would cover what I was earning from him and what the international company I worked for paid me, plus the profits the platform would generate.\n\nTwo years have passed, the platform has users but still doesn't make any money, and to this day I haven't seen the partnership contract, the project is kind of stagnant, and I'm extremely anxious because I feel like the project could fail at any moment and I'd go down with it.\n\nBack then, I was single and still lived with my mom, so I didn't have much to lose, but now I live alone with my wife.\n\nI've been looking for an opportunity for about 4/5 months, only a few call me for interviews, and those who do, I can't get past that stage. I can easily do all the tech challenges I receive before the interviews.\n\nI don't know if I'm conveying some insecurity to the recruiter regarding my stability at the company, since I left the company I worked for after a few months to try this \"opportunity,\" if there's something wrong with my resume, if I've gotten rusty in my English from not practicing for a while. What would you do in my place? What do you suggest I do differently?; I think I just had the worst technical interview of my life. It was on SQL on HackerRank. Got my logic down for my query in less than 3 minutes.  Typed in my initial CTEs tried running that and was getting an error and tried to debugging. I felt so stupid, it was just simple initial filtering statements. I spent a good 10 minutes debugging it. eventually just ran a select \\* from statement turns out the oracle emulator was bad. So the interviewer moved me to MySql emulator.  My logic needed a Full outer Join and I had coalesce to deal with the nulls. I wasn't aware that full outer joins were not a thing in MySql so im here debugging that for the majority of my interview. I was supposed to answer three questions but only finished one. I just felt like it was not a good show case of my current skill set and the time spent debugging I probably looked clueless to the interviewer because I didn't know which errors were mine , a syntax difference between oracle and MySql or a limitation of MySql.  Part of it was my fault too. I felt like I was in my own head by the end of it and was making syntax errors I would never normally do like missing commas between select expressions or just misspelling table aliases.  any ways FML \n\n  \nshould I ask my recruiter for a re interview and express what happened during mine. I know it is competitive out there and this was a really bad show case. The interview was yesterday and I haven't heard back.; I think it's okay to poke every few days after an interview. People are busy and get distracted on other things but it's often in your (and their) best interest to keep the ball rolling. Especially if the company has less than 1k employees, it's generally on the hiring manager to push the process along. Just let them know you really liked them but you have other late stage interviews and are trying to figure out how invested you should be in them.; It can take a while to hear back. For two of the companies I interviewed with (medium-sized company, big bank), it took a few days. For Meta, it took a full month.\n\nI’d wait maybe a week before asking if there’s an expected turnaround time on a decision, but don’t be surprised if it takes longer.; Recruiter may have just gotten pulled into something, I'd try shooting them an email and give them the benefit of the doubt. Be nice to them and they'll probably reschedule.\n\nKeep in mind recruiters often have far less invested in each hire than hiring managers do, especially if they're salaries and not commission based.; Just play the numbers game! It sounds like you're confident in your technical abilities and passionate about your field, so you'll definitely get something if you keep at it. The job market is much worse than a few years ago, but there are definitely still jobs available! You can also try researching companies that are hiring and politely hitting up their recruiters and EMs on LinkedIn with some thoughts on what the company could be doing that they're not today.; At a larger company (ie Google or Facebook) they can't do anything about the 3-4 week review times because there's a lot of processes in place to prevent discrimination or nepotism.; If that's normal, then that makes me feel a bit better.

If the bachelors is cheaper (maybe consider taking some core CS modules related to backend?) \n\n- Have you considered adjacent job roles (i.e data analyst, data engineers) that may lead to backend engineer roles in the future? \n\n- Can you utilise USyd's career office or participate in any upcoming career fairs and network with recruiters?\n\n- Might consider practising leetcode too as it may become useful for future CS job interviews.\n\n  \nYou are doing great! 💪 Just my two cents and all the best!; you wanna be a backend dev but you have a bachelors in chem and neuroscience..? \n\nGet a job that fits your degree, then move adjacent into a technical role. I think it is unrealistic to expect a cs job right out of school without the education or experience. Pivoting your career is possible but it takes time. The other option is doing a research based masters and getting intern xp and publishing a paper.; You have 4small projects in python yet you've been \"seriously coding\" for 6months ? What; I clicked on your github and the first thing I saw was sorting algorithms 😂; You don’t need a Masters. They’ll still reject you, with one.; You should check out /r/CSCareerQuestionsOCE; You can look up OMSCS program. It won't cost you a kidney to study and would give you something to do, during job searching.; You can also check UPenn online MCIT offering. It could give you some more clout globally compared to OMSCS, because it's ivy league but it'll cost you 4x/5x times the cost of OMSCS, so around 40k $; I'd think that finding a job in chem/neuroscience would be slightly easier because now is not the easiest market for people to find jobs that they didn't study for. Especially as a fresh grad with no work experience.; Are you sure masters will help you land a job?; OMSCS mate! You even tick the 4 year degree box that lot of aussies struggle with admission due to their 3 year degree; I think you are throwing good money after bad, there are very few employers that would distinguish between someone with a bachelors vs a masters; Sorry to be blunt but you have no educational background in CS and projects are really simple which is what I would expect a first year to do except your 2D game which is a bit better and would be a good project for 2nd year; You know australian has favourable visa to work in us for tech. Google or search  in linkedin, the ad keep appearing in my timeline.; [removed]; Australia doesn't have a good tech job market compared to other developed countries, unfortunately. I think another CS degree would probably pay off in the long run. I got another bachelor's in math and it's been a very good investment. You could try OMSCS fron GA Tech but I don't think you will get in with your current profile tbh. They want CS (or related) courses on your transcript.\n\nAlso, I had no idea that tuition was that expensive in Australia. Jesus, that's pricey.

Depending work they do, give them some freedom is possible how they approach problem, what they work on, and hell maybe come up with own idea of work.\n\n4. Their intern unless they catch hr complaint nothing they do is a failure just learning lesson. Expect literally nothing from an output pov. Just focuse on how you can improve their ca journey and yours from a teaching pov.; Just wanted to say I’m a junior dev with 1.5 YOE and I have an intern I’m supposed to mentor starting next week. I’m honestly kind of freaking out because I feel lost half the time myself, I don’t know why they decided to give me the intern considering I’m by far the least senior on my team.; Don't hover over their shoulder. Instead set SMART goals (look it up if you're not familiar) and have regular touch bases where you review their progress. Give them some ownership of their goals. Make it a two way discussion. People are much more motivated to do things that they committed to doing rather than things they were told to do. High motivation means you don't need to babysit them. \n\nYou need to figure out a good balance on how much work load to assign them. Usually you want a little more work than they can achieve in a given time frame. Too little work and motivation drops and they get even less done. Too much work and they'll burn out. You want to teach them about prioritizing their work so the occasional task which they can't complete in time is okay. Encourage them to be the one driving the discussions around what they can complete and help them build the confidence to say when a task won't be finished on schedule. Schools instil the idea that things have hard deadlines and that when you submit something it's done. In the real world things take as long as they take and you keep working them until they're up to a sufficient standard. \n\nMake it clear to them what times you're available for questions. Don't just assume that they'll see your calendar as being empty and book something or that they'll message you. Interns can often be intimidated about reaching out for help or they can feel that it reflects poorly on them to ask questions. You need to actively and constantly dispel those misconceptions.; Put a regular meeting on their calendar where they can just ask you questions. Let them know they can cancel it if they don't have any.; Some things I like doing during mentorship:\n\n- Set check ins at a cadence that works for them. If they want daily and you can accommodate it then go for it. Also, be willing to change that cadence as time progresses.\n\n- Make sure that you help them prioritize their work. If it's their first internship experience then they might get caught up all the different things they could implement, so make sure to teach them how to deliver the core deliverables.\n\n- Make sure to have fun. Their impression of you and the team can largely impact their opinion of taking a return offer; That's probably why they gave you an intern. It'll challenge you and teach you a lot about communication and leadership. It's ok to be nervous about it, just make sure to lean into it"

   "Title": "Is pursuing a MS different than data science, ok?",
   "Top Comments": "I like your idea of looking for jobs for 5-6 months with graduate school being a backup plan. Has been done forever. What I dislike is the degree.\n\nA bit of a hot take here. Data Science is a worse degree than CS or engineering for CS since it's easier. We're in the world of 100 applicants in the first 12 hours. At my experience level, I struggle to find jobs that aren't 20% paycuts. I recommend applying to American-owned and Indian-owned consulting companies. They hire entry level, including for your degree.\n\nCybersecurity degrees, what I've consistently read here, are bs. They're also easy as you know and don't qualify you to do anything. Recruiters would rather you have a CS degree because at least they know you can code.\n\nI met one Cybersecurity professional with a Computer Engineering degree. He said it's all on the job learning. He's into writing employee emails that look like viruses to check the rate of opening. A degree program isn't going to give you a company's stats on that or let you practice. He also said a big part of his job is how to maximize his time. Not worth looking at employee's web history unless they're under investigation. Again, that comes with work experience.\n\nGeorgia Tech has a well-known [online MS in CS program](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/degree-programs/master-science-computer-science) that is extremely cheap. There should be a subreddit for it. Is a legit program, people do fail out of it, but it also means it will help you in the job market. Lots of discussion of people with business and liberal arts degrees taking prereqs and so forth to get admitted. You're in Data Science so you may not need to do anything and are in a better position to succeed.\n\n>Lastly: if you’re wondering why not pursue something like AI, machine learning or something...This master’s program seems a little easier\n\nEveryone and their mother is piling in ML/AI. Won't be enough jobs for them. Master's program being easier is a negative like I was saying.; I've worked in data science right before the whole degree program trend started. It doesn't make sense to me that you can get an \"undergrad\" degree in \"data science\" when you just take courses: you don't actually do science. IMO, that's the value add you bring as a data scientist, you have experience doing science, and can independently execute research against the needs of the company.\n\nTherefore, If I were to get into data science again, I'd definitely be going to grad school. You don't need to be that smart to do research, you just need to be persistent.; You can choose whatever major for your MS. But I think you should choose wisely. I personally am going to think a Cybersecurity Analytics degree is not as good as a degree in cybersecurity, or a degree in analytics. This degree feels like just a mix. I would think advanced degrees should be more specialized. If your BS is in Data Science, and you want something else, why not get an MS in Cybersecurity?"

Invite them to the roadmapping sessions so they can be your approvers to make sure product gets what tech debt along with new work to be done for your investment mix. \n3. Put together a Gantt chart as to who is aligned to what projects so they can see how the team is divided up . \n\nI’d make the case to leadership that Engineers leave because they get bored and want new challenges. People stay because they are challenged and have a good team to work with.; Netflix shit; >He said their sales team and other departments have measurable numbers to show performance and he feels like it is not fair to them that the engineers do not.\n\nYour CEO clearly has no idea about how to work with engineers. Our work is a lot harder to measure, even for us, because it's a problem solving endeavor. One way to possibly measure performance has to do with impact and number of tickets closed/points tackled, but even then all of that has limits and is extremely imperfect because it's so easy to cheat.\n\nJump ship. Your CEO doesn't know what he is doing and is unlikely to change his mindset.; I get what he’s saying, he just doesn’t have the engineering knowledge to define the metrics himself correctly. He’s conflating the technology with the people building it and while they are reliant on each other you can’t really assess one via the other. Sales isn’t really team sport like engineering is so I can see why he’s confused. \n\nYou need to counter by advising these are two seperate issues. For tech give him some better metrics - DORA, reliability, latency, patching etc. for engineers, some sort of competency framework      that managers can use to evaluate their team members.; In the future i would recommend just shutting up and agreeing with whatever they say to avoid drawing too much attention to yourself.\n\nBetter to let other people call this kind of thing out while you look for a new job; Isn't it obvious that this guys just want a way to measure you so he can look up a number on a spreadsheet and decide who will be fired based on that number? My guess is that there's a huge layoff coming up and that's how they'll decide who stays and who leaves.; So CTO left and CEO and remaining management has no idea how to manage software engineers or what you guys do. Do they plan to replace the CTO? Do you get the feeling the company isn't performing financially? Or that your department isn't meeting deliverables on a regular basis?\n\n\nIf they're generally happy with the team's performance, they might just be trying to figure out how to manage software engineers and need some insight into your team's operations. Or they might be looking to do some layoffs in the future. Kinda hard to tell given typical CEO weasel wording.\n\n\nIf the team is running smoothly and they're generally happy with performance, they maybe should consider moving someone on the team into the CTO position and mostly continue running things as they are now. If it's a constant shitshow, it seems like a good opportunity to make some big changes. They'd probably still be better promoting internally if someone seems to be emerging who could lead the team.; So dumb, all this will do is punish a culture so that devs are too antsy to pick up challenging (and risk prone) work.; This sounds like a strategic time to bring up engineering failures and ethics as an example of why ranking by time and shoddy work is a terrible idea. \n\nI'd also recommend reading code complete a little bit to be able to learn how to formulate further arguments as to why this strategy of theirs is inevitably going to generate a massive amount of future costs to them through crushing accumulation of technical debt.; Point systems are for capacity planning and feature prioritization, not performance evaluation.; Don't dig your own grave, this is corporate. Lie all the time and ask for forgiveness in whatever God you believe later.; You can't expect a CEO to solve a problem  that the whole SWE community has not been able to solve. Picking who to reward and who to let go depends on a lot of factors, including the strategy and cash flow of the company.  The SWE who can keep the business lights on is not always same SWE who creates the most new features. There needs to be a manager who knows who does what for the company.  There's no automation or methodology that can substitute for that knowledge. ; One thing to understand is that engineers are smart, often smarter than their own leadership. If certain things are incentivised, they will optimize in that direction. So if you start paying engineers who complete more story points or PRs more, your smartest engineers will start optimising their work so they can show lots of story points and PRs completed. What they *won't* do is optimize to deliver the best possible product or most innovative solutions, since there's no reward for that anymore. So where before you had your smartest engineers thinking about how to add value and deliver good products effeciently, now that job is fully on the shoulders of management and product, who probably are not as smart as your engineers when it comes to building things.  \nThis is where, IMO, non-technical managers fail when leading technical teams. They think they can out-smart the engineers. Technical managers know they can't.  \n\nAlso, by the way, if you read the Agile Manifesto, it lays all this out. The top priority is delivering working software. It's not completing lots of story points. Points are supposed to be a tool to help acheive that end goal, not the end goal itself."

Other countries have laws about working past certain hours a day and employees are entitled extra compensation for it. This stuff doesn’t exist in the US.; If you’re regularly getting pinged for on-call doesn’t that indicate a larger issue with your departments systems and process?

It might not even be other devs.\n\nTake note of how the business operates at a broader level, and ask yourself: \"If I were to own this business, what experience would I need to gain? What skills would I need to acquire? What's the simplest version of this business that I could start today?\" Not many people think this way and end up on the hamster wheel for their entire life. Don't be that person. You'll end up unhappy and jaded.\n\nBe a sponge in every way: Learn the tools inside and out. Learn the org inside and out. Learn your manager inside and out. Don't just stay home on the weekends. Go out and meet with coworkers outside of work.\n\nTrack your results: Every time you contribute to a positive result for the company, make a note of it and put it on your resume. Quantifiable results are extremely important.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that massive company internships are a totally different ballgame compared to startups. When you play the big company game, usually your focus is \"how do I get better at programming? how do I move up? How do I get paid more?\" whereas [working at a startup](https://www.talentramp.co/), there's more of a \"How can I make an impact on the world? What cool shit can I build? How are customers impacted by what I'm doing?\"-type of vibe.\n\nSo I'd just say, don't rest on just this one opportunity. While it's great to have an opportunity in-hand, don't be afraid to look externally at other companies. The full-time offer may not happen in the end anyway, so hedge your bets.\n\nLastly, have fun! College and internships are the most fun you can have with the least amount of responsibility. Take risks. Fuck up in small ways (errors of action *only*, not inaction).\n\nGood luck!; A couple things regarding code reviews... One is to comment on your own PR's.

Of course, competition is worse in the hubs, but the jobs are so much fewer and further between elsewhere that it feels like an impossible conundrum. If you can find remote, that’s extremely lucky.; Yeah, but that's just me. I think it really comes down to how your resume matches the given market.

If you jumped a level quickly because you took advantage of the over hiring trend going on in 2020-2022 then you need to realize that’s over… companies are only putting up money for people who are qualified or ideally over qualified for the roles they are filling. Not being mean but realistically 0-3 years is entry/early career, 3-5 is mid, 5-7 senior, 7-10 is senior/principal. Obviously everyone wants to work in a level or two up because it pays more and everything is expensive now but it’s just not realistic to expect that level of accelerated career growth out of school in this industry. It’s not sustainable at all. Engineer with just over 10 YOE providing some insight. If you have the skills and have a good work ethic then you will do very well just keep at it and best of luck 👍; Have you started applying?; Have you started applying; There is some serious title inflation going on right now; I got a senior role with roughly 2 years of experience; In comparison to the number of senior postings there just aren't that many mid-level roles posted. The ones that are posted, however, always have hyper-specific tech stack knockout questions, where if you haven't used exactly everything they are using then you get auto rejected. Some of them are absurd and won't consider you if you have Azure Functions experience instead of Lambda or Postgres instead of Oracle. I have been applying to the handful of mid level roles that show up every day though.  \n  \nAlso, it seems many companies don't have true mid-level roles and only differentiate between senior and junior. My previous company only had junior, senior, and principal.\n  \nJunior roles seem to have far fewer absurdly specific knockout questions and there seem to be more postings in general.; Thats something that is transferably to most industries. The years don't reflect how good you are, the variety of experiences do.\n\n\nYears will just make you more familiar with the specific topic but that has diminishing returns without variety.; This exactly.

   "Top Comments": "My experience is if you've been in the industry long enough working on different kinds of problems you will eventually run into an issue that is impossible or extremely tedious to solve without a debugger. Most people likely use a combination of both.; In a large code base, setting your break points and jumping through the logic seems to be the fastest approach.  Sometimes i still print stuff out but for the most part, i try to use my break points.; I use both, depending on the issue.; Almost never use the debugger anymore cause it's tedious to set it up for async processes or non-local envs; Assuming you are talking about JavaScript and not compiled languages, if I need to see a variable at the end of its lifecycle, I’ll use console. If I need to know when and where it gets modified, I use the debugger.\n\nEach tool for its own purpose.; Usually my first step in debugging is using a console print statement, but then if I spend a good amount of time on the bug, I will use the debugger, lots of times the debugger gives too much information.; But... the console is where the printed statements appear.....; Debugger on server shit, print statements on front end shit unless I've locked in on the issue then debugger; Print for FE, debugger for BE; I do Android, Android studio's (intellij) debugger it's awesome so I use it a lot, except for race conditions, when I dipped my toes on react native their debugger is hot garbage so I used console logs way more; Only logs. Can't always count on replicating an issue locally - logs need to have enough information to find & understand any bug.; So... I technically do know a lot of fancy stuff like debuggers and profilers and have built my own, more than ok using IDEs of several flavors - all that doesn't mean shit in my current job as you're basically living in the command line remoting into different random bits of tech and adding prints here and there.\n\nLarge codebases are usually complete enough to not need major development and have the added \"bonus\" of never fitting properly in a single development environment with useful features so it's prints prints prints all day long unless I happen to be working on a coherent module for longer or need to look around somewhere I have no clue about running random bits of code.; If you work with distributed systems, you’ll need to at least use logs.; Some of both. I might do print statements if I want to see just one thing or how something changes over time. Other than those, I tend to use a debugger;; I'm a Google engineer and our online editor doesn't support debugging for Android, so I'm a print statement guy. Every now and then I'll come across a problem that is too challenging and requires a debugger, and then I'll switch to Android Studio.; For multithreaded stuff in C++ GLOG (googles C++ logging library) is pretty much a requirement if you wanna debug stuff IMO.; Print statements all freakin' day.; Debug console for most things print statements for when I want nicely formatted times for when I want to see which section of the code is taking long; I work a lot with BLE devices and often trying to step through code is kind of broken.  Something in the device state will change when I'm stepping through and it messes it up.  Whenever I'm working on something else, always the debug console, otherwise mostly print statements.; Debug console always if it's an option, which it usually is. But then I mostly code in C# and Go. The only times I don't use one is with languages like Odin where the tooling is in its infancy and setting up the debugger is a faff"

   "Title": "How common is production database access in technical roles?",
   "Top Comments": "I had read only access at a previous job, but am happy to have no access at my current.; idk if it's common, but from my experience at least that sounds horrendous. i didn't even like it when sister teams that didn't directly maintain a set of dbs would create tooling around it. i personally believe the team that owns the db should be implementing ways for others to access it safely that way they can audit all the operations.\n\nwhat you described sounds horrifying id be so stressed; Not necessarily uncommon depending on the nature of the prod DB and *who* it serves.\n\nNonetheless, it's very silly to have a whole team with direct write access to a production DB in many cases. Even read-only access is somewhat of a liability, since DBs can often contain user information that would be breachable.\n\nHearing this, I'd assume they're working with a small mom and pop shop that maybe recently launched their app or acquired a legacy app. Getting these features *into* the app so that DB privileges could be safely revoked would probably be an important undertaking if I were thrust into owning that kind of liability.; Admin tooling that lets engineers query production data in supported ways and redacts PII and other sensitive values is very common.\n\nLetting engineers log in to the production DB and do whatever is generally a terrible idea.; i have access but like you mention we have processes and procedures around it. Not always enforced though. Sometimes you need to do some sketchy shit and you need to do it right now. \n\n> I was shocked to find out that running manual SQL queries against the production DB was a part of the normal day-to-day of this team.\n\nI could see this making sense. For our dbs because they are so large, a bad query can bog it down (ask me how I know), but if you had small or relatively non-critical data I could see how this would be normal work. I have a friend who's work is mostly statistical and they data they use is nonexhaustive anyways, so running manual queries is the norm; smh... I don't get paid to answer these questions anymore.  Short answer (from a database expert SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) probably not the end of the world.  Let's be honest, there are 24 hours in a day to fix whatever mistakes that get made and now have to be rolled back.  :)  Backups will help, but that data is now changed.  If this is the process, don't be pissed off when you screw it up.\n\nAnd, if this is banking software .... god help you.\n\nAny haters, do your research before throwing darts.  Just sayin.; I work at a large, household-name tech company. SWEs _do not_ get production access, and the process for obtaining tightly scoped access is extremely controlled and requires solid business justification (e.g. you _have_ to look at a customer’s data to fix a specific bug they’re seeing, there is no way to reproduce it with test data, and they have provided affirmative, written consent in a support ticket).; It's definitely the best practice to limit prod access as much as possible. If something happens where you need to run raw SQL against a DB, that needs a proper change management request, and ideally your company has a way for that to get reviewed, validated, tested, and applied via a very structured process.\n\nBut not all companies follow best practices. Joining a big F500? Doubt you'll have write access to the DB.\n\nJoining a smaller company / startup? They're much more likely to have accepted the risk of giving engineers direct DB access in the name of speed. They don't want to get bogged down by process, and red tape. This is what \"Move fast, and break things\" means. They're OK with the risk that comes with giving that level of access.\n\nI've worked at 2 startups, and had read/write access at both.\n\nI've worked at 2 F500 companies, and was strictly read-only.; My current and last company used just in time access control and 4 eyes principle for every query. Also sanitized read only replicas or scrapes for non incidents.; Make sure you have backups.\n\nManual read queries common, ideally to a read-only mirror not otherwise used in production. Usually only a few very trusted people should be able to do unstructured write queries, since you can delete the whole DB by forgetting a WHERE clause.; A lot of companies have to adhere to audited security/process standards and controls that would almost certainly not allow for that type of direct access. (e.g. SOC-1/SOC-2, ISO-27001, etc.). This includes pretty much every company that is publicly traded because they have to adhere to SOC-1. SOC-1 is basically trying to make sure your company isn't pulling an Enron and doctoring financials. Also, companies that provide services to public companies will often have many of the same controls because part of the process compliance requires vendors to also comply. And smaller companies in certain industries (like finance, government, accounting, medical, etc) will have them due to regulatory compliance requirements. \n\nIt is, however, not uncommon to see questionable access stuff like that in smaller companies that work in less regulated areas like e-commerce, or marketing.; I was given production db access as a junior within 3 months and expected to do manual queries and fixes.; Big companies: no access\n\nSmall companies: free to run SQL queries that chatGPT generated on live prod db's; Read access for higher level developers isn’t that crazy, especially if they help with support tickets from customers and need to see the data. If anything requires actually changing the db though that should have some sort of ticket associated with it; I work at a startup. All the engineers have access to prod databases. Access is logged and monitored, but no approval is required to access it. Before running a mutating query, we ask for review on Slack.; If you're like my company.....they gave me prod db access my second day on the job. Coincidentally.....that was my second day as a software engineer ever as well. I got the job fresh out of college. 2 days after college I was on prod running scripts  🤦🏾‍♂️.\n\nFast forward 2+ years later.....I basically live on the prod database. Every time I ask the team, how do we get this set up on our test databases? The answer is always \"we dont, test in prod\" 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️.\n\nFunny enough, I have FULL access to prod 24/7. But I dont have access to the testing database that the QA team uses for testing.....make it make sense please!\n\nWe dont even use the QA database. 9 times out of 10 I am told to run my stuff on production AS SOON AS IT'S FINISHED. Zero testing, zero code review. If my ticket gets marked done I'm immediately hit with a teams message saying to go ahead and release that change in prod.; > I'd assume they're working with a small mom and pop shop \n\nNope, big company that you're likely familiar with if you're in the US.; This is what I understand to be the best practice as well.\n\nOf course, in real life, it can't always be prioritized, but that doesn't seem like a good reason to throw out the baby with the bathwater.; > Sometimes you need to do some sketchy shit and you need to do it right now.\n\nWell put -- this will always be true.\n\n> small or relatively non-critical data I could see how this would be normal work\n\nAFAICT, it's just garden variety prod DBs. And many of the people running queries are amateurs (i.e., non-programmers just doing copypasta from various docs).; When I talk to him, I always preface my criticism with saying that I know all kinds of worst practices happen IRL... but the best practice is... There's the reality and there's the ideal.\n\nThe problem is, in this particular example, I think things have gotten out of hand and there are no grownups around who are even aware this is a worst practice.  Other teams seem to be relying on the services of this team to get their job done, never mind how.\n\nI predict that some day, a VP or Director is going to show up and find out what's going on and put a stop to this en masse."

It's a part of your manager's/co-workers jobs to make sure you don't reach the point of a PIP.\n\nThe formal PIP is a last resort. It's an ultimatum. The company has announced their intent to fire you. Everything that was supposed to happen prior to this point either didn't happen at all (failure of both parties), or didn't work.\n\nSaid in a simpler way, the PIP isn't the first step for a poor performer. It's the last.\n\nStart looking for another job.; Consider your PIP an extra 60 day salary; My friend survived a PIP.  He became so disgusted and found another job in two months.  I would do the same.; IIRC the number thrown around is 10% survival rate on PIP. So you have to be stellar AND lucky.; 60 days of PIP is too long in my opinion.  \nWould you like having 60 days of stress trying to perform in order to meet/exceed their expectation?  \nThen at the end of the PIP they deem you not worth it?\n\nI would suggest look for other job while still spend the bare minimum to meet daily PIP quota on the current job.; Even if you survive PIP, your raises/promos/tech suggestions would be so gimped you were better off hopping for a better environment/raise.; Start interviewing ASAP and try to find a company with better management that's a better fit for your skill set.\n\nTwo management red flags I noticed from your comments are that they consider your Python skills inadequate and that they treat 2 week sprints as hard deadline. \n\nIf your skills aren't up to the job they had in mind, they shouldn't have hired you. If they hired you in spite of that, they should have provided you with sufficient mentoring to get you up to speed quickly. If you couldn't keep up with mentoring, provided they gave some to you, during your trial period, then they shouldn't have extended it.\n\nIn well run Agile/Scrum team (a rare thing), sprints shouldn't be hard deadlines or used as metrics to rigidly judge developer performance.; You might, you might not. But no matter what, I'd start looking for a new one now.; The reality is you only put people on PIP if you're trying to get rid of them. It's not a \"turn your performance around\" plan like the name suggests, those are what one-on-one meetings with your manager and skip level are for. By the time you get PIP'd it's way too late. It's not even really an ultimatum, it's the first official step towards firing someone. HR and at least director level managers sign off on it because they're ready for you to leave the company.; A PIP is the company saying “we would fire you right now if we could, but we have to check boxes first”.\n\nIt takes a 180 with not only your work output but your networking skills to get people to change their mind.  It’s hard to come back from because it’s not designed for you to come back from.  It’s designed to fire you while trying to squeeze what left they can out of you.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases you should put in your 9-5 then immediately start applying elsewhere.  Do not put in extra hours at work.; Get the fuck out as soon as you can.\n\nI had a PIP and got fired shortly after their Senior Engineer came back from maternity leave. Eventually I realized they didn't want me.\n\nI still remember walking into the office, being asked into a room and being told that despite how liked I was, how much effort I put in and how much improvement I had shown, it wasn't enough.\n\nNow I realize that I was set up for failure. All that documentation wasn't used to help me, it was used as evidence to justify firing me because they knew what they were doing.\n\nI would say that you probably have a <10% chance of surviving at best.; I was also put on a pip a month ago. Was let go yesterday despite meeting all the goals/ objectives. Hate to say it but PIPs almost always end in termination. I would start looking for a new job and not take it so personally.  Plus you don’t want to work on a team that has already left a bad taste in your mouth.; >is a PIP considered to be \"the end\"?\n\nPretty much. While there is a chance of survival, the purpose of PIP is so the company has a paper trail so you can't sue them for wrongful termination. They're already looking to fire you.\n\nDo the bare minimum and start interviewing elsewhere.; This is a 60 day runway for your job search. Use it as such.; I’ve beat a pip. It turned out fine. But overall I wouldn’t bother to try again.\n\nThink of it this way. You’re averaging a 65% and told you have 60-days to bring it up to 70%. It’s likely possible, but it’s not going to get you 80+% which would be rocking it. And everyone happy with you range. \n\nIt just gets you into the “Eh, I guess that’s good enough” category.; Your position has likely already appeared on job search boards.; The answer depends whether your PIP has objective and measurable goals. Mine didn't. So I called management on that, quietly noted their lackluster response, and quit with no notice the next week. Six years later and no regrets. Best professional decision I ever made.\n\n\nKeep your head up and your eyes open.; You now have 45 days of paid interview practice, how many apps have you put out? Cause in 45 days you don't have a job.; Its very simple - they put you on a 2 month pip. In the same time they could train you skills. Or provide any other means of improving you if they wanted.\n\nIf they already “warned” you before, I doubt it will end well."

My company has stopped considering boot camp candidates for entry level roles and I expect the rest of the industry will do the same if they haven’t already.; No. 4 year grads from top schools can't find jobs in this economy, and you think 3 month grad will?; I don't think coding bootcamps are worth anything if you can learn on your own. Portfolio can help you with employment. Credentials from reputed organizations can be helpful. Harvard Extension School offers graduate certificates. Microsoft offers cloud certifications.; No I don’t recommend that and I say that as someone with no degree (working towards one) that broke in via self taught.\n\nGet a degree. Save yourself the heartache and stress.; It works for some people, it doesn't work for others. It's not a guaranteed path to a job, even a CS degree isn't a guaranteed path to a job for everyone. Will it be for you? Can't say.\n\nIt's a non-traditional path into the industry, which makes it a *difficullt* path into the industry.\n\nEven when the market was red hot in 2021 and a lot more bootcampers were getting hired... it was still more difficult than with a degree. In a bad market, where people with CS degrees are struggling, the bootcampers are generally struggling even more.\n\nI personally wouldn't ever recommend someone do a bootcamp as their primary form of education. That's just my opinion.; What's your current experience and how much time do you have? There are ways to make lateral moves without going to bootcamp that may get you the same thing you are looking for. Happy to help you.; I did one of the camps that pays you during training and then gets you interviews with their clients. I would recommend that route. They will let you go if this isn't a smart move for you and you aren't out the tuition. Just keep in mind I had to sign a 2 year contract with them. The market is pretty rough for new hires. If your work history is great, and somewhat relevant and you have any degree, you probably have a leg up on getting your foot in the door. It's still a big risk to career swap any white collar field right now imho. BC jobs are where our economy is booming right now.; It really depends on how good you are at the end of it and how lucky you are to get exposure to the right roles that won't give you an automatic rejection. 3 months is a very short amount of time and while maybe some people will become proficient in that amount of time I feel that not many will. In which case it would be really difficult to find a job. If you are really gung ho in going to a bootcamp I would study on my own to make the most of it. If you stand out in your bootcamp it would obviously raise your chances at getting a job in comparison to someone who is not memorable or memorable for the wrong reasons.; You can do your own research on bootcamps. Most do a good job teaching the tech skills but not the 'getting a job' skills. \n\nI mentor people one on one over 4-6 months with a focus on getting you good enough for an entry-level role and strategizing the job search. \n\nIf you're in sales - as I once was - you should have no problem with the networking part which is key to getting your first job. If you want a guided path to learn technology dm me.; Do you have a college degree, even if it's in the proverbial underwater basket weaving? This can help you get your foot in the door where a lack of any degree would hinder you in most cases. If your degree is in a STEM subject, it will be even more helpful.\n\nHow much software development have you learned on your own already? The successful bootcampers I've worked with have been highly motivated self-learners who already knew a lot of stuff beforehand. Bootcamp essentially filled in a few knowledge gaps, taught them jargon and interview skills and provided placement contacts.\n\nAre you willing to take lower paying, regular corporate, jobs? These are jobs that pay in the lowest 20% nationally and regionally (speaking US market here) and often have less than ideal working conditions, such as 100% onsite and awful legacy codebases.; [removed]; It worked for me. I do have a degree in chemistry but used the boot camp to learn web development. I went to a free boot camp where they made money by contracting out graduates. Boot camp is LaunchCode, they're STL based and primarily focus here.; I’m in real estate and sales now. It is very different then tech; What bootcamp did you do?

   "Title": "Finding Consulting Work?",
   "Top Comments": "\"Consulting\" != \"contracting.\" It's not gig work either like UpWork. The majority of 1099 work in this field is low-priced full-time work. Some of it is high-priced full-time work. I used to be at one of the latter. Honestly, you're not going to beat your FANG earnings through consulting so don't worry about that being the big money - it's not. But it might be a way you can get meaningful extra cash.\n\nThe sort of work you're talking about pretty much always comes through referrals and your network. I'd suggest:\n\n* Look for local meetups. Offer to present on your special topic.\n* Focus on groups that have corporate sponsors. They usually will credit sponsors. The sponsors usually come because one of the group's organizers made a connection to someone in the company that can spend money (i.e. the people you want to know.)\n* Look for any local VC or investment groups. It helps if you are also one of the investors, of course.\n* Connect with any boutique dev or design shops near you. They are also hunting contracts, but they're probably looking for full-time work so they aren't competitors and so they're often happy to have connections to hook up and vice versa.\n* Look for local \"teach CS to high schoolers / to teen girls / to under-privileged kids\" programs. The kids won't be your customers (not for a while anyway) but the other professionals in the program could be.; You have to network. Go to meetups or ask your friends/ex-coworkers if they know anyone that needs help. Lots of small businesses are getting hit up by unemployed software engineers looking for consulting work though, so you have to stand out and cold outreach is pretty dead.; The best way is going to cultivate to have partners that will bring projects to you as the moment you have to go out and look for roles is when this becomes your startup of you.; Yeah, I've gotten a few solid part-time projects from ex-coworkers. But, I'm looking for more work.... currently I'm only working \\~15 hr per week at \\~$150/hr.\n\nAny ideas on specifically when/where to network? Conferences? Conventions? What sort of meetups?\n\nI do find it really strange that companies are very keen to hire me full-time/W-2 but not hourly/1099? When I say I'm only open to 1099 currently, they always sound disappointed and say it might not be a good fit.\n\nDoesn't hourly/1099 save the company money? They don't have to pay for health insurance? They don't have to pay unemployment? They don't have to pay me when I'm not actively working (we all know CS involves some amount of downtime)? They don't have to worry about when/where/how I work?; By partners, do you mean, like recruiters? Or firms? Or other developers? \n\nI was hoping there was a CS equivalent of PricewaterhouseCoopers. They (PwC) provide high-end legal, tax, management and data analysis consulting services to other companies. Their data analysis work might be relevant to me, so I sent my resume to them yesterday. Maybe they'll get back to me. \n\nBut, I was hoping to find a something like PwC but for actual software development/machine learning where I could consult on architecture and algorithms rather than just analyze data and produce a PowerPoint. \n\nAnyway, I'll keep googling \"professional service\" companies. Maybe I'll find one that provides AI/ML/CV services.; Shot in the dark: they prefer W-2 because they already have headcount approved, but for 1099 they'd need to approve POs to pay your invoices.\n\nAlso, it's not necessarily a savings: I mean, \\*you\\* still have to pay most of those things out of your earnings, so....; Pwc also does SWE consulting they call Tech Consulting but it doesnt necessarily pay as high as you might be hoping; I'll look into PwC.   \n  \nI'm starting to think the reason consultants charge so much is because they have a hard time filling their schedule and only get paid for the hours they actually work. \n\nI can charge $500/hr but I may only get maximum 10-hours a week of work. Or I could work as an FTE and get $100/hour (converted to a salary) but I would work 40-hours a week but get sick time and other benefits + the company handles marketing, accounting and advertising. \n\nIt's an interesting tradeoff... I guess I need to decide which I want. There's no free lunch :)"

Also, if you don't want a job working in that language. Looking at YOU, COBOL. And PhP.

   "Top Comments": "It really depends on the top management. Your manager and your manager's manager may like you. But the director or executive level will do whatever the fuck they want when they want à la Elon Musk. Trust your gut based on what you here through the grapevine. Usually, conversations with the manager's manager will give you a better clue, but you're likely not going to talk to them much unless you're doing really well or in big trouble.\n\nMeanwhile, all you can do is make as much progress at your role as you can. Have a portfolio, an updated resume at all times, and build your savings. Then, the worry will subside over time.; It could happen. But you can’t affect management decisions in any way, so make the most of your first job. The more you learn, the better your chance of surviving layoffs or getting a new job if they affect you.; The reality is that everybody is at least a little bit worried about layoffs. It's justified.; Layoffs are a lot less scary once you realize you are in demand elsewhere. That doesn’t happen immediately in your career. Also, save up and be prepared. It’s easy to not stress a layoff when you have enough money to support yourself for a long amount of time.; If it happens, it happens.  Prepare yourself financially and you'll be fine.  That means living way below your means, acquire minimal debt.  Once you have the ability to go several years without income at all, you feel a lot more free and less worried about the whims of leadership.\n\nWill it be fun to do that?  No.  You'll be watching everyone you know spending as much or more than they make, but if times get tough, they'll be stressed and you won't be.  Recognize that tech has always been a fundamentally unstable field, and that you're likely to get laid off at some point.  Plan around it, and it's no big deal.; You really shouldn't be worried. Worrying won't put you in a better situation or help in any way. Just do your thing and if you get laid off, update the resume and apply for jobs.\n\nIf you're feeling anxious about layoffs that's probably a sign to boost your cash savings. You'll eventually have enough cushion to where layoffs won't seem so scary.; The only thing that's under your control is increasing your skillet to become more highly paid and in demand.  That's what you should focus on, not the possibility of being laid off.  Rather, focus on the concrete steps you need to take to get that next much better opportunity.; Fed is saying inflation is coming back under control which could mean a rate cut. If they do that then layoffs will start getting less frequent.; If the company will start laying people off, it doesn't matter who you are, you can be affected. New hires don't get any favourable treatment here, quite the opposite, because you are more likely to be on the bench or underperforming for the first few months\n\nCompany known for stability is good, don't worry too much in this case; You got the job enjoy and embrace it, nobody knows nor can control what tomorrow will bring so make the most out of today.; All about business unit and bottom line. If you’re on a unit that is tied to revenue generation you’re much safer than if you are not.; It happens but depends on the company. Plan out exactly what you're going to do if you get the boot, and then try not to worry about it anymore.\n\nThere's so much to learn at the start of your career - I'm still going through it. Best not to worry about stuff that you can't control. You have a job - that's better than a lot of folks out there.; 1. don't panic\n\n2. new hires are cheaper to hire than your experienced talent so you tend to not backfill positions at all or go with less XP to reduce your overhead in the MBA everyone is fungible body handbook. If they cancel all travel, get rid of consultants and really start digging into expenses, it's likely not a great sign. \n\n2A Layoffs depend on keeping the company alive . If a division is just a bust and there is nothing that can be salvaged from it then that likely may get shuddered. Things don't happen that quickly so pay attention to the reports internally and to shareholders/press externally.; 100% yes, and I agree it's bullshit. We once hired our intern full time, then laid him off 3 months later because (stock market). Sounds bad until you realize that gave him a (90 day?) clock to find a new sponsor or get deported and have to move away from his (still student) wife.; Unfortunately there is always a chance.\n\nI mean you can look at how the company is doing and be aware of economic news but you can never be sure. In my case I was working for a local real estate company. The signs where there (high interest rates, less houses being sold than the years prior) but I was still blind sided by the lay off.\n\nTruthfully I was waiting until my 2nd year to apply for another role.; Have a 6 month emergency fund in a high yield savings account and chill.; Every hire should be.; Stock price actually is a good indicator. The two public companies i got laid off from both had cratering stock prices. Obviously the stock cratered because of some public information.; Be good at what you do and build some savings.

If they find out, you're axed, but they have to find out.\n\nNow if you do list company B on the resume or background check, they will confirm start and end dates and see you have no end date.

   "Title": "Am I hindering my development career by being a \"Low Code\" developer? ",
   "Top Comments": "Yes you definitely are hindering your career. Low code tools are exactly that, you don't actually get exposure to real world coding. All you're doing is getting good at using the low code tool/framework.\n\nWhile there are transferable skills using low code, such as problem solving, critical thinking, logical reasoning, etc., you'll be much better off as a traditional software engineer where you're practicing these skills on top of programming languages and frameworks. \n\nThere are many abstractions that low code tools use to hide away the complexity of programming.; Context: Which low code tool? There's lots out there. If it's one of the big ones, as per Gartner Magic Quadrant, there's always jobs going.; Outsystems huh? Wow.  At my previous job, we used that briefly for one product and almost no one in the group had that skill set.  So it made it difficult for knowledge transfer and for migration.  Actually, the old timers that have the domain knowledge all know the other low code tool the main system was developed in, and they often got pigeonholed into doing the legacy projects.\n\nIt was a slow and long migration effort, and the developers had been away from OOP and for so long that this contributed to that.  \n\nOne way they combatted that was to do the automated tests using .net / c#.  And they slowly moved a lot of the API’s from this low code tool to Azure functions where they wrote it in c#.\n\nIf your org doesn’t have any plans to migrate or at least move some of the functionality or testing to more traditional coding, it could hinder your future prospects and development.  But on the bright side, it really is job security because a lot of organizations don’t want to fix what’s not broken.; This sounds like a steady and secure job. You should study more modern tech on the side in case you are let go but this job does not sound like it’s going anywhere. You’ve been there less than a year so it’s probably too soon to hop.; What is considered a \"low code\" tool? I'm wondering if I use them at my job; I checked.thebotwhr comments and there is good consensus, the problem I see in your situation is your pay,  because of the career limits imposed by working in low code those roles usually pay more than the equivalent market code ones; so the fact that you are Gett Ng paid below market when it should be the opposite is a red flag.\n\nThe trial for fire is to try to get another low code job  at a different company that pays you more.; I have a very different pov.\nIt is REALLY good you started with low code. Learn everything you can about how to design a good system - the way Salesforce handles permissions, resource ownerships, pub-sub, event based logic (ie triggers) etc is the best in the industry and you get to see what a perfect implementation look like.\n\nWhen its your time to build something from scratch, you’ll know what a good end product should be, and thats half of the work.; Yeah, it'll definitely hurt your career prospects. \n\n\nI worked in a similar environment in the past and the non transferrability makes it harder to find a different/better paying job. I was lucky enough to have some projects in Java so I emphasized that and left the low code stuff entirely off my resume. Had a couple colleagues with the same back ground (similar \"low code\" tech stack) and they also mentioned that it hurt when they needed to find a new job.\n\n\n\nThat said, it's not an insurmountable barrier. If you go into management, your lack of coding skills won't matter. And you can always get around the lack of on the job skills by writing code in your personal time.; Only professional case of being good at low code would be game engine scripting, such as Unreal Engine Blueprints. some folks make a living off these kind of scripting, and those are essentially low code. Pay isn't high though.\n\nthat said, the few friends i know that do this, also know how to program traditionally; they just don't do it for a living.; It will likely hinder your career but it's not a career killer by any stretch. Still, I'd advise you to get a more traditional software engineering job as quickly as you're able.; Yeah, it's going to hurt your career. There are things you're expected to know as you gain experience and the longer you keep working in low-code the worse it will get.\n\nHere's a video to explain it. Please watch at least 2 minutes of it as it's very relevant to your situation.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqYMXVbXvTM&t=50s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqYMXVbXvTM&t=50s)\n\nFredrik says it best.\n\nBtw I was there and I studied a lot in my spare time and slowly worked my way into a SWE position, which you can do. It takes time but it's do-able :).; Agreed with all of this. My first job was as a Salesforce developer that I stayed in for 3 years before moving on to a faang as a more typical software engineer. This is positive to share in that low-code is not a \"career killer\" or something, but I do wish I started in a traditional software engineering role as I feel like I started with weaker fundamentals than other developers starting with 3 years of experience.; Outsystems; Ah interesting, yeah from what i can tell the companies applications are going more and more into the low code era. As stated there are a few things that are still on legacy systems like their AS400 for example. I did say in another post that i tried to apply for a more traidtional role, but didnt have too much luck, as shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/19cv64a/my_job_search_over_a_4_month_period_as_a_24_year/). Infact ive had more recuiters reach out to me for other low code positions more than i have for traditional roles. My main concern is that down the line when i know that im going to be wanting more money, im not sure that low code options can provide me with that, either that or im really just getting shafted with my current pay.; Initally the plan was to stick this one out for around a year to get my CV bulked up with atleast some form of consistancy, my last positions capped out at 10 months each, so I feel like my CV is more important then my job satisfaction. Another note was that i was applying for traditional developer roles before this one, and it didnt go well at all, i made a post about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/19cv64a/my_job_search_over_a_4_month_period_as_a_24_year/) actually. And i did get many more offers for similar low code stacks.; I work with OutSystems exclusively.; Most of this stuff is abstracted away to the point you’re not really learning anything when you implement; Issue is that you still need good developers to implement it all. The Salesforce ecosystem is riddled with pretty bad devs. A lot of accidental admins (people who became the go to salesforce person at their company who used salesforce) turned dev. \n\nYou end up with organizations that are pieced together by people who have no software engineering background whatsoever.; That’s inspiring to here. Have u got any tips on how you made sure you weren’t ‘pigeonholed’ and eventually managed to land a more traditional developer job?; It depends on your role though, no? I’m a salesforce developer, have about 3 yoe with salesforce specifically. I don’t build any flows and only build solutions that require code. Consultants and admins do the click “development”.\n\nThe upside that my role is basically just a regular software engineering role and everything that comes with software engineering. The downside is that if I go somewhere else as a salesforce dev, it’s likely they would expect me to have exceptional knowledge of flows, process builder and all the other low code solutions salesforce peddle. Which I don’t. Matter of fact, I have never built a flow (other than maybe in trailhead). \n\nIn general, I consider myself to be a software engineer first. I specialized in salesforce. Not that different than someone who specializes in springboot or dot net. Helps that I have about 5 years of experience before I dipped into salesforce and have worked with other languages and frameworks."

They knew accepting you that you’d be a student.; Keep asking.  At my school they own IC.  The corporation might argue they do too.; The worst they can do is fire you. Just accept the offer and work with your manager if there is something you’d like to pursue. No need to be standoffish or “assertive”. If it becomes a problem, quit. If you have 3 other internship offers, maybe skip this one. If you have 0 other prospects, this would in my opinion be a poor reason by itself to pass on one.\n\nWe have a similar clause in our employment agreement, and over half of our masters/phd interns asked for exceptions. And my HRBP always says “that would be between you and your manager to work out”. For the exceptions I’ve considered, I’ve only encountered issues once. And its because the kid was burned the fuck out from juggling too many things, and was caught sleeping in the lounge for ~2 hours while on the clock on multiple occasions.; Did they respond in writing? Just get an email exchange, but I highly doubt this would be enforceable in the U.S. ; you just do it and dont tell them. why would you even ask? who cares? what are they going to do send a demand letter to your professor and say they own your homework? \n\njust ignore it.; This. Or detail the work you intend to do and ask them for written permission to research it on your own, in advance.\n\n\nDoes your college have legal resources you can consult about this?; I mean I want to be 100% safe and not end up getting a “it’s in a contract but you violated it so now we’re going to sue you” and get in huge trouble; Yeh it’s academic research project.; Good point! I sent another email with the details (to get publication). Idk I hope they are not too annoyed with me; They did. I sent them another email still cuz I’m paranoid lol; Shit we’ve seen from these companies recently, I wouldn’t be surprised if they did. Especially if the research panned out to something profitable.; In order to sue you they would need to prove they incurred damages. What do you envision their damages would be from you doing academic research outside their business domain?; I'd be less worried about them suing you for breach of contract than suing you for ownership of your research; This. Companies can go a far way for their interest so I don’t want to risk; Good point, thanks!; Good point. Either is worrisome as I don’t want to abandon current work progress; They won’t. They’d be competing with a university system, suing the state for something they have no reasonable claim to (assuming it really is outside their business domain). You really don’t have anything to worry about. You got verbal confirmation to carry on. Don’t make a problem where there isn’t one."

You will not be able to perform the job and will be vastly outclassed by folks who have put in the work to develop their skills. Consider a 4 year degree in CS/software engineering.; Its worth it if you really like it and are going to code (at least) 6+ hours a day for the next year. Also, if you really like it and are set on it to the point that you are okay with the fact it might take longer than a year to be employed. That would probably make you somewhat competitive for entry level positions, depending on the projects you make, and if you are good at solving DSA questions. I would also network a lot. Since you will not have a CS degree or a bootcamp certificate you NEED to network. Even for CS students and bootcamp grads the first foot in the door is the person you know who will give you a referral.   \nYou also need to be honest with yourself. Are you a fast learner?

Perhaps you're one of the plenty aforementioned. Everyone learns in different ways. Some need a formal academic structure while others are autodidactic and can learn how to be a self-made hacking genius in a few 15 min YouTube tutorials.; So like.. if a degree is not an option, just drop it? I keep seeing very contradictory opinions and I don't know if I should just give it a go because there's a chance or focus on something else; Yeah, just drop it.

Not anymore. Go put in the hours for something else unless you actually love software.; I can't answer that for you. It all comes down to personal drive.\n\nThe people who are successful without a relevant degree are generally extremely driven, are constantly learning, and practice their skills relentlessly. 10,000 hours is not an exaggeration.

   "Top Comments": "Take your time, choose a path which is right for you.; Hi! Both are great opportunities, but for different reasons. If your goal is truly learning, the graduate program is probably the way to go - primarily because it will offer you a new organization to learn, an opportunity to understand the differences between sizes of orgs., and will give you insight into the role you really want. Other things to consider: What is the work/life balance like for each option? Is a move involved in the latter option? Do you have a specific mentor at the company where you are that you feel it would be beneficial to stay with? You have two great options on your hands, you really can't go wrong. Best of luck to you!; Thanks! \n\nAppreciate the thoughts. \n\nDo you think it could be deemed as a downgrade to go not take a senior role and take a grad program instead?\n\nEven though, I do think the grad program has better trajectory eventually.; I think it's all about how it fits in your narrative and how you explain it. If you feel a future employer is questioning why you didn't jump for the senior leadership vs. take the opportunity to learn more and grow, that's how you phrase it. You wanted to expand on your skillset, move closer to the area you truly wanted to be in, and understood that there will be senior roles in the future, but you need more skills first if you want to be more versatile.; Thats a great point!

If it’s just for the money, don’t bother, there will be passionate people out there with more experience and a better pedigree to eat up those opportunities. This attempted arbitrage by every person looking for a high paid job and picking tech because they think they can do it in months is so annoying.; There’s always room in healthcare and any other job that requires manual labor.; Those \"university bootcamps\" are just normal bootcamps that partner with universities so that they can slap a reputable name on them. A good chunk of the people that help you have little to no experience in the industry. That being said, did you take advantage of all of the networking opportunities that they should give you? That is the largest value in a bootcamp.; Markets move up and down. Right now is a downturn, so you are up against more senior people with full fledged degrees. As for security, it's hard to make out safe pockets within industries. I have heard that legacy software is a niche that is both safe and boring, since you'd be working with outdated frameworks, maintaining them beyond their lifespan. The problem is that if any industry decides to switch and pull the plug on their old stuff, you'd be left hanging again. It's a hard situation to be in.; As a general rule in CS: the less competitive the field is, the more difficult to get in. The required level for \"good enough to work\" is just higher in more niche fields.\n\nSo no, no safe place.; Anyone wanna start our own bootcamp? Im starting to think thats the safest bet lolol.; If you have the opportunity to get a bachelors in CS, I would definitely recommend it. Bootcamps do a more disservice when it makes people think there isn’t demand for software engineers. The unfortunate truth is that bootcamps do not do enough to prepare people to be a software engineer in most cases. Most companies aren’t willing to take the risk. They instead choose to hire college graduates with relevant degrees. \n\nTo be fair, a CS degree on its own doesn’t completely prepare students for the job either. Just about anybody starting their first job will have to learn some tough stuff on the fly. But companies value the security theater of a 4 year degree. When it comes down to it, a boot camp just isn’t enough time to learn what is needed. A college student can goof off for 4 years and be just as far from being ready. But at the very least, those 4 years provide more opportunities to learn more and to intern.; Embedded software engineering is pretty niche and thus less competitive. Pays slightly less, but still pretty good; [removed]; IMO no job is easy to get into rn.

If you can be good, don't give up.; I personally don't have a problem with gifted people getting jobs in CS fields without a degree. A degree is, in essence, just another cert. But if all you are is average, and that's obvious to the employer, what benefit is there picking someone with no experience and no degree over no experience and a degree? At least a degree shows they've spent more than 6 months considering this profession.; Doing a job for passion is the rarity. ; Ive been trying to break into this field coming from web dev but so far no luck; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

If you go to school now, you could finish by the time the market is done being so crap; How many people you think would be a SWE if the pay was 40k? can't imagine it to be much; Money and profit was the original driver for high wages.

   "Title": "Is tech really this male dominated?",
   "Top Comments": "It's tech. It's going to be men only pretty much. You get the odd female dev here and there, and they're usually fantastic one way or another, but its going to be 80-90% male the majority of the time.; In lucky environments you can reach 1 female every 4 men, but rarely more than this; At my last firm we had 3x female programmers on the team, however they were all offshore India based, prior to that we had another female programmer (also offshore India).; Oddly enough, it is particularly bad in the US. I've worked in tech in India, UK and the US and the US has lower ratio of women engineers than in the UK or US. That said, you'll find that there is a ton of women in the product side of tech\n\n\nI think it just came down to how the US society looked upon computer science as a largely nerd and \"boy\" things, while humanities,  psychology, etc., were the preferred fields for girls in the 80s and 90s. I notice this is changing though in recent years; Woman here! Hoping to help change this :-); I'm on a team that has a great balance of men and women and diversity of many ethnic backgrounds. It's a stark comparison to my previous role where it was majority men and majority Indian (only like 4 non-indians: 2 white, 2 black); I worked for a company that was 40% women devs in the 00s (healthy mix of visa holders and citizens) but then they offshored the entire dev shop lol; One phenomenon is that sometimes women feel more comfortable joining companies with other women. So if a candidate only sees men when they interview they may not be sure about whether they’d feel welcome at that company. This can create a bit of a cold-start problem. \n\nI’ve never seen this problem fixed.; I have read somewhere -  here on reddit - that 40% of women leaves the tech industry within 10 years. \n\n\nI only worked with an almost all male team once - and decided to never again. ; It has been my experience to work with basically zero women. I really would love to see that change.; I think it depends on the country. In more developed countries the ratios are not that bad, but it's still male dominated. I studied in eastern Europe and in my classes there were like 15% women. And some of them went into teaching and non-engineering tech roles such as project manager, so an even smaller % ended up as software developers.; [deleted]; In Asia it’s balanced; We have 2 women in the entire DevOps team of 25. One is my manager and she hired me. I Iament this silently to myself almost every day. The men are nice but it's just not the same as when I've had a supportive woman colleague in the past. It really sucks. It is that male dominated. In fact, there are 37 women /181 employees as reports under the SVP of technology. That includes the woman office manager.  That's about 20% and that's considered \"good\".; It is a male dominated industry but I think that has been slowly changing. The variability of male to female ratio it might depend on management actively recruiting woman as well. \n\nI’m of the mind that diversity of ideas and styles can help people grow and become better. I think too many men or woman in some circumstances can lead to some antisocial tendencies. For those reasons I’d like to see a bit of a change but people will gravitate towards where they feel comfortable.; Yes, absolutely. Tech is extremely male-dominated, especially when it comes to engineering. You get a female programmer here and there, but it's very rare, maybe 5% at most. Much more women tend to go into business analysis, QA, management, etc.; I wouldn't say \"dominated\", but there are definitely less women in tech than men, but I don't see any problem with that. In my firm, men obviously outnumber women, but our female devs are treated like valued members of the team. We have women in management roles, and every single one of them got to where they are based on merit alone.  The reason why we have less female devs is simply because there are less female applicants.  ; I think it's possible that it's just the case that men are more likely to experience the conditions that lead them into the field. In particular males have higher rates of social isolation than females. \n\nI distinctly remember spending prom night in my basement writing code.; Yes it's that bad. \n\nAlso, woman/women is probably a better word choice than \"female(s)\" here. I spent a little over a decade in the non-profit tech sector and there was a lot more gender (and ethnic) balance there. \n\nUnfortunately the pay was not great, but I really miss working with those kinds of teams.; Tech is a sausagefest.

   "Title": "What is the reason behind all of these lay-offs?",
   "Top Comments": "near zero interest rates caused tech to over hire. The hiring spree also caused rapid increase in salaries and costs to companies for labor. Money was free though so that didn't matter. Then inflation happened and then interest rates rose to counter it. Companies suddenly need to actually pay people with money they make instead of free money from the fed. You have all these expensive ass engineers that you hired and revenue line up with your costs.; Pandemic over hiring due to low interest rates as well as tech hype. When the tech hype died and interest rates rose, layoffs came about. \n\nNo, lower interest rates aren't going to fix all these layoffs. Only time will fix the job market and it will be years before it recovers. 2000 Dot Com tech bubble didn't really fix hiring until the mid 2000s. Then came 2008 and ruined everything again.; I think it's a number of things. \n\nFirst, as others said, the increase in interest rates meant that companies can't borrow money cheaply to do things. So they are holding off.\n\nSecond, a lot of companies hired way more people than they needed because they wanted to hoard talent and keep them from going to competitors, hoping that things would keep growing and they would have a use for all these people. Then that changed. \n\nThird, Wall Street greed. Shareholders want more, they are demanding more, so they're demanding companies cut staff and expenses to increase shareholder value. They don't even care if teams end up understaffed and people burned out as long as that value increases. \n\nFourth, I'm sure some of this is also to try to put power back in the hands of employers. They want to kill remote working and make their commercial real estate investments worthwhile again. They also want to kill all of the increased salaries that happened due to the competition for talent. Really they want to create artificial job scarcity to give them back the power. \n\nFifth, the price gouging that we claim is inflation is also costing companies money. So they have to cut costs somewhere.; Over hiring is a BS excuse. When you're reporting large profits, you didn't \"over hire\". \n\nIt's a concentrated effort by executives to drive down wages industry-wide so profits go up.; When interest rates were practically zero, if you had money you could borrow more money for basically free. Remember when apps gave you amazing service for almost nothing? Watch almost every TV show or movie ever made for eight bucks a month? Get any food delivered right to your door for a couple dollars? Get a ride anywhere you want for a third the cost of a taxi? That was all subsidized with that good free money so more people would start using those apps and the companies could grow. Wall Street rewarded the growth and stock prices went up and the venture capitalists who borrowed all that free money to subsidize unprofitable companies made huge returns.\n\nUnfortunately it turns out the people running the tech industry are only visionary geniuses until the \"unlimited free money\" faucet is turned down. Stock prices went down.\n\nCompanies made their apps shittier and more expensive because they had to actually start making a profit, but there's only so much customers will tolerate. They also started laying people off, and it made their stock prices go up. So more companies did layoffs, even though they were making a profit, because that also made the stock price go up.\n\nLegally, the primary duty of corporations is to reward their shareholders, and their leaders are heavily incentivized to do that in the short term at the expense of long term stability and profit.; i heard welding is the next big thing\n\nzirp gonna zirp; IMO it really started when Elon Musk fired 90% of Twitter and nothing happened to the site. Execs noticed that. If a tech company has a product already built and isn't innovating anymore then it doesn't really need many people to maintain it.; Expenses up, market down 👍🏼; We all know why... nobody dares to say it... but the truth has always been obvious. The reason behind all these layoffs is something far more sinister than anyone could have imagined. \n\nIt all started when the quantum gerbils of Sector 7G began their dance of the fourteen moons. Each shimmy and shake sent ripples through the corporate ether, causing a chain reaction that disturbed the cosmic balance of the office Feng Shui. As the vibrations intensified, the algorithmic overlords of Spreadsheetopolis activated their contingency protocols, unleashing a barrage of pink slips upon the unsuspecting workforce.\n\nAs the moon reached its zenith, a rift opened up, revealing the true mastermind behind this corporate chaos. None other than Plankton from the Chum Bucket! Yes, it’s all part of his elaborate scheme to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. By triggering mass layoffs, he's creating a world where the only employment left is flipping questionable chum burgers at his dastardly establishment. The layoffs are just a diversion to distract us while he executes his grand plan.\n\nSo remember, the next time you hear about another wave of layoffs, just think: It's all part of Plankton’s nefarious plot. Stay vigilant, Bikini Bottom!; Economy being horrible, inflation of college graduates and requiring tons of experience to get through the door; I think there are a few reasons. I genuinely think one of the major reasons is a lot of places just ended up with too many staff and they are now correcting that.  I've also read about the removal of some sort of tax credits for R&D or something that made it beneficial to employ software engineers but less so now.  A lot of the big tech companies laying off staff are making great profits so I don't believe it is something they are being forced to do. Maybe it is just them being prudent and trying to increase margins. The downside is they could appear ruthless and will then struggle to recruit talent in the future.; A very real aspect is that AI tools are starting to make existing software engineers more productive. I can do the job of 4 people now where I used to only be able to do the job of 1.\n\nEdit: don’t shoot the messenger - downvoting me won’t change the reality. My company has chosen to not hire additional people or engage with 3rd party software development services because we are more productive internally. We are not the only ones.\n\nIf you want to be coddled and told everything will be okay, this is not the field for you.; Immigration ; I think a great comparison to the job market are the streaming wars going on right now. Back in 2020, a new streaming service would cost less than $10 and have a ton of brand new content, but since growth has stagnated and subscribers watch less tv these days, prices have gone up and fresh content has shrunken. Companies have grossly overestimated the value of their potential market share in a fast changing environment and have put their progression on the back burner in order to recover loss. Companies do not want to take risks, because their competitors aren't taking a risk. Tech burned too bright, too fast and now the new grads are suffering from it.; \"Near zero interest rates\" isn't a normal phenomenon. We're still in an environment with abnormally low interest rates, and it will need to rise higher to return to normal.; Pandemic over hiring was glorious. Entire hiring process contained in a single 50-minute interview and offers $10k above what I was asking. Yeah, lower interest aren't fixing this mess. Wages down across the board and way too many applications for every position. Companies cutting down on tech spending and asking more for less.; To be fair, even now, we're still pretty above pre covid hiring. It is no where even close to the dot come bubble or 2008. It just seems worse becuase there was such a rapid increase and rapid fall. The last recessions were really bad.; What's that Google and Meta? You made your highest fiscal profit ever but still need to do layoffs, and outsource to Mexico and India? Damn....nobody could of seen this happening...; I agree. During the covid boom engineers were becoming really in demand and engineers knew it. So we started asking for higher wages, remote work and overall a higher QOL. I believe these layoffs are a coordinated effort by tech companies to drive wages down.; It is not.\n\nA company that has cash, from earnings or capital investment, cannot just sit on it. It has to allocate the cash in a way intended to please shareholders. In a low-interest environment, the shareholder preference tends toward taking risks for future growth, which can include building new teams and lines of business. In a normal-interest environment, the preference tends toward efficiency and paying the cash to shareholders."

   "Top Comments": "Hey I'm a recent grad. In order to remedy the gap that is developing on my resume I've taken up unpaid work for a small business (creating a web app to replace their current third party software that requires a subscription)\n\nCan I put this on my resume as work experience even though there's no formal employment (no 1099, background check won't show any associated payments with my SSN)??\n\nIf anyone were to ask me technical questions about it I could answer them very insightfully and substantively, it's just not real employment though so it wont show up on a background check :(. If the business is contacted then they would definitely vouch for me!\n\n\n\nIf things go well the business will eventually put me on 1099, but for now it's not documented and I was hoping I could still use it as something to bolster my resume while I continue applying; Does anyone know any case of someone relocated to a different country by company and then laid off shortly after?; **How to structure preparing for interviewing after 4+ years at the same place? Feeling overwhelmed**\n\nI work at a large software company and have been for the last 4 years out of college. \n\nIt's time to try something new, but I'm anxious and uncertain about how to go about the seemingly huge amount of prep work ahead of me: \n\n* studying interview answer frameworks..\n* systems design.. \n* behavioral questions.. \n* mock interviewing..\n* reading books on all of the above..\n\nAny guidance would be very appreciated; Rules say:\n\n>Promotional or advertising content regarding a person, service, or website must go in the monthly stickied thread on the first Sunday of each month.

I remember it being very hard to get my first job with many companies I wanted to work for not hiring new grads or ghosting me in the interview process. I know the overall job market for software jobs has been tight in recent years, have people still been able to get into interviews and land jobs? If you have, what's worked for you? If not, what's been frustrating about the application process? I'd love to hear more about your personal experience going through this process and I'd be happy to provide professional advice if you DM.\n\nFull disclosure: I'm a senior leader at a mid-sized Silicon Valley startup looking to learn more about the gap in university education so I can help make new grads more competitive in the job market. I am not hiring for any specific roles right now and this research is outside of the scope of responsibilities for my role. Mods - I don't believe I'm violating the rules of this subreddit but if I am I apologize and feel free to reach out to help me make my post more compliant.; Why do people go for FAANG?\n\nI’m a May 2023 grad, and have worked with the same company since Summer 2022, so i don’t really have the perspective on a diverse set of jobs. I understand that these companies have stellar pay, but the combination of being in HCOL areas, the seemingly constant threat of mass layoffs, nonsensical return-to-office schemes, and overall crunch culture seem like a fucking nightmare to me.; Are there any resources for getting software engineer resumes reviewed? I have a little over 4yoe and am starting to look for something new.; Hi, so I am a tester (manual) for 2 years and my employer said we can choose to move out of QA.. I kind of want to be a developer but my anxiety is too strong, I’ve never done proper coding before (java) and would need to go back to basics\n\nTbh idk the purpose of this post but I really do want to go dev, I’m just not sure I’m up to it\n\n\nAppreciate any and all advice, thanks!; Would a customer success analyst be a good first start into tech? Taking prereqs for masters in cs right now, only science experience + degree.; Need your opinion on leaving good team for bigger money\n\nEnglish is not my first language, so I am sorry for your eyes and brain strokes in advance\n\nTldr: leaving really comfy team I am really grateful to for unknown job after several abusive team leaders, feel sad and guilty, but current paycheck is (almost) a joke. Want your opinions and stories\n\nTo put it shortly:\nWorked with several idiotic team leaders, ended up in FAANG with toxic leader again, was even bullied in an argument few times (I am not a genius, but there is no way I am/was as dumb as I was referred to), wanted to leave, but decided to temporarily rotate. New team (and team leaders especially) turned out to be super cool and my performance reviews skyrocketed, so i got graded up to strong middle+/fresh senior very quickly. \n\nThing is, my salary sucked because of stagnation in previous team (heard “you almost graded up, just needed few more <insert dumb kpi like written lines of code>, what a shame” far too often) so now I have an offer for another companies that agree to pay me base salary i could only get with all the bonuses of maximum performance review grades (which is super hard to achieve)\n\nWhile money is tempting (achieving numbers I am offered would take years of grading up), I am extremely sad and worried from the mere thought of telling my super nice higher ups I leave, almost feels like a betrayal, cause i cant see my imposter syndrome and massive hate for a job being treated without these guys and now I just leave:( Sadly, I most likely wont be able to raise my paychecks using counter offers cause difference is too big and I already got a 20% raise few weeks ago\n\nWas somebody in this situation? Is there something wrong with me and feeling sentimental is dumb?; Im a recent grad and want to do backend dev. So I'm thinking of learning spring or .net in just a few weeks while applying .But idk if entry role for spring backend company really cares about that at all, or they just want you to know about OOP, algorithm and Leetcode. And for those .NET companies, is it the same?; How common is it for 2 recruiters (from/via dice if that matters) to both reach out to me at the same time representing the same company and position.\n\nIs this any weird or anything normal?\n\nSeems the company is a staffing agency, but they are skipping the training part of the WITCH company game?; hi, so I have 1.5 years left,no internships only class projects). I don't go to a ranked school and was only able to afford college due to a scholarship which covered tuition only(worked very hard to get the scholarship in the first place) and if I end up jobless, I will devastated, I grew up in a household(grew up on minimum wage single income) ? Any advice, I'm like very scared.....; Absolutely! In fact the person you working for would likely give you a glowing recommendation if they feel guilty about not properly compensating you 😂; They could be a good pace to start your career. You learn a lot working with really smart people, and there are good processes in place that can give you a solid foundation for your next career move.; First, expect all serious answers to basically be \"it depends\".  Certainly when it comes to matters of preference or personal choice.  Second, I don't disagree that most of what you mentioned are ... things to consider.  \n\nBut to address the examples of \"why not\" you gave:\n\n> HCOL areas\n\nWe'll first ignore people who live there already or want to independently of a job.\n90k at a place that costs 30k to live, is objectively worse in just numbers, to 180k at a place that costs 60k to live.  This is just an idea, not real numbers.  Of course 180k at a place that cost 30k to live would be even better, there's likely trade offs for that kind of CoL.\n\n\n> the seemingly constant threat of mass layoffs\n\nmass layoffs is better than randomly getting fired.  which, don't kid yourself, is always possible.  also, just because you don't work for google this last round of layoffs doesn't mean you aren't at risk of a layoff (with much lower severance, and not necessarily a guarantee of recommendations from a \"name brand\" tech firm).  early 2023 linked in was filled with people trying to get their voice heard over the massive amount of \"name brand\" laid-off folks.  The smaller companies were also struggling, but people aren't upvoting the posts of people from said smaller companies as much.\n\n> nonsensical return-to-office schemes\n\nI don't get this one.  I haven't seen many places without rto complaints.  Full remote companies tend to have been full remote before the pandemic as well, or at the very least, very flexible.\n\n> and overall crunch culture\n\nI don't get this one either.  FAANGs tend to be constant hustle not occasional crunch.  (Can you tell I don't do product?).  On the right team it's actually chill (too chill for some younger swes).  It that's crunch to you, then, pour one out for the game devs and be glad you aren't one.  For the most part, seems to me it's more that if you're capable of the work and incapable of carving out personal time, they will take advantage of you until you quit or change yourself.  If you actively defend your wlb, you tend to be okay, short of other things like issues with management or poor project leadership, or someone decided they needed an extra 18billion this quarter etc etc.\n\nThings FOR working at FAANG, which I won't be so wordy about:\n\n* clout\n* pay\n* stability (usually)\n* scale\n* benefits\n* wlb\n* the tech/tools.  my god the tools.\n* if you rub shoulders with the ones that make the company possible, which is harder and harder nowadays, you learn a LOT\n\nThings I would add to the \"why not\" list:\n\n* honestly not enough coding for some people.  you solve problems, not perfect code.  this heavily role specific.\n* legacy is forever.  except when someone high up decides it's time for a wholesale change of something like the core language of an org.  actually, even then.\n* the tools are so good you spent most of your time when you hop to a none FAANG missing those tools and get called tools for proposing to build them.; TLDR people (well, 50/50 in my case), organisation, tech\n\nPersonally I enjoyed good working processes and stable payments. All smaller companies I worked in sucked in terms of organization and community (currently deciding to leave faang and losing all the social environment is one of the saddest things for me, never felt lonely with this number of clubs and stuff)\n\nAlso I had hundreds of super qualified collegues that new ten times more than me (working in smallet companies felt like some seniors were dumber than me and the coding culture was non existent, so when I moved to faang I discovered a lot of good practices I never even thought of), also there were some super advanced closed source libraries that were super fun (and difficult) to study (super high performance algorithms written by international gold medalists, for example; although I was a math/icpc medalist in my country, I was blown away by how complex and fine tuned SOTA solutions can be)\n\nDownsides included a lot of competitionism and always feeling like you work for an evil corporation (although you never get to make evil decisions and they just… happen?); Why wouldn't you? What are the downsides?; Why not give it a go? See if it is something you enjoy. If you're going in as entry level, they're not going to expect you to be a super-coder on day 1 and should help you learn.; Yes, It is a CSM role.  Good entry level role.  Do it for a year and then move to a product or software and become a sme there.  All of the big tech's have this role..master's isn't necessary for the role, and it only matters for the recruiter."

This is the worst I've seen the market in 10 years, the entire time in industry. If you can just stick this job out, you'll gain experience, the market will recover, and you'll be in a much better position to earn.\n\nEarly jobs like yours definitely suck, I've been there myself, but if you play things for the long game, things will work out.\n\nSorry about your dog.; I'm not sure where you are located but $14/hr sucks man, I feel for you.\n\nThe hardest part of this field is getting your foot in the door and the market isn't what it was just 2 years ago.\n\nMy advice would be to tough it out for as long as you can and build up your skills. Keep developing on the side as much as you can but, be weary of burn out.\n\nTry taking on harder problems at work, not because you're aiming for a raise or promotion (but if you get one that won't be a bad thing) but so that you have more things to talk about and list on your resume for your next job. Look for things that will be impressive: refactoring old or unstable code, finding ways to improve performance, a cool feature that would be beneficial to your users some one hasn't thought of yet. Those types of things will go a long way when it comes to looking for a new job.\n\nThe goal is to go into your next interview and be able to say things like \"I improved our process X% by doing Y\", or \"I championed feature X that improved user's experience by Y\"; Yeah the experience is the only reason I am toughing it out.

I left that job and thought I would never program again, but I ended up getting a super chill low paying job that gave me some breathing room to get back into engineering.; I'm at 25 years and I am really burnt out. I applied for a PM position. If I don't get it, I'll lose my grip on reality. Last term, between school and work, I had to learn 3 languages at the same time. I wanted to decompile my professor.; I often wonder the same myself.

Find a gov / public sector or large enterprise known for good work life balance. You will take a pay cut potentially, but still will be more than majority non tech people. At places like this you can get away with 2-10h work per week sometimes, like adding new field and getting through 20 processes and teams to get it tested. Make it remote and you can do anything you want in life, focus being outside working. Do extra rewarding, walking, traveling.

If so, I think the obvious thing to build is a password manager, but the issue there is that's starting to become commodity software, with several established entrants offering about the same feature set and competing on price.\n\nOne problem, is that users cannot possibly remember all of the passwords to everything they sign into.

I wouldn't be able to remember a password I created once, months ago, but need know to get to my 401k.\n\nThe second issue, is the reduced entropy. if someone has your forward hash (img -> password), then their password is only equivelent to the bits of entropy in the picture.

While I can't say anything about your school's program specifically, I've seen at a lot of other schools that the electives are actually pretty useful for your career, covering topics like Web and App development, DB design, etc.; [deleted]; Employers generally don't care about minors or second majors.

You need to know discrete math, operating systems, data structures, whatever. Academic fields of research within CS may be related to some of these concepts, but extremely more narrowly focused and much more advanced than what would be in an undergrad class.\n\nIn general you can check the research areas of CS professors to see the kinds of sub-fields they work on (should be on the university website for the CS department), which should give some sense of what is out there.\n\nThe kinds of fields and specializations in industry tend to be much more (with some exceptions) about software development and testing because that's what industry needs. It's more about the kind of software and all about system design and building things to spec given real-life constraints of time, budget, quality, etc.\n\nA CS degree tends to be much more about the theory of computing and less about hands-on practice for writing production-ready front-end code for a mobile app, for example.; When did you get your first internship? I probably don’t know enough or am old enough to be considered for an internship. Did it help you to narrow down what you liked, and in what ways?; I was talking mainly about career fields. My thought process is this: if I find a specific field of cs that I like before college, I’ll be able to focus more on the classes that will be the most helpful in improving in that area. If I wait until I’m in, or have been in college for a few years, I’m wasting those years trying to find my passion, rather than being able to do what I like.; In most situations, internship opportunities start showing up around your Junior year.

As you learn more and get exposed to more ideas you'll naturally figure out what type of development you like, dislike, or can put up with for a paycheck at the least.; For you specifically, did you have to go out and search for internships, or did the companies present internships to students in hopes of getting more applications?; In my case our CS department would email out internship opportunities and I applied to one such email. \n\nWe also had various recruiter events and career fairs that I attended for juniors and seniors where various companies would come out and try to hunt down some new talent.; Thanks for the information!

I can tell you right now that a person with average IQ (100) is not memorizing 20+ LC hard questions without spending a serious amount of time on it. \n\nAt the least, an average person is going to need to see 1 year of highly focused education in data structures, algorithms, and math. A lot of LC is simply impossible without algebra. \n\nBut you already know this, unless you're trolling - the average college graduate is 114 IQ. Leetcode is ultimately an IQ test, but it is interesting in how it allows different \"methods\" of learning to succeed.

   "Top Comments": "Lost of jobs are listed across multiple cities even though they're the same job hiring for one position. That inflates numbers. Lots of jobs are expired too. Not sure if this affects Germany job listings in the same way. Just saying LinkedIn, while better than Indeed, still has problems with this.; I hope you're taking into account those spam job and expired job posts.; Canada's tech market was never that strong but it basically evaporated ever since they raised interest rates.; Canada definitely doesn’t have stronger tech market anymore. Whatever startups we had due to low interest rates during the pandemic and before covid have taken big hit. Mostly it’s the big banks. FAANG hiring has come down a lot as well. You also have to take into account huge immigration in Canada which increases the competition for jobs and low salary with high cost of living.; In order to have a better estimation of how the tech market is going in a certain country you should always consider the ration between the number of jobs and the population (better if you have an estimate of the graduated people who can access such jobs, but still work with the general population).\n\nThis because US has almost 4 times the population of Germany.\n\nEDIT: Grammar; FYI - pay sucks on Germany compared to US and Switzerland.; I would guess China and India has more jobs \n\n\nBut in the western world yes, it also goes hand in hand with population ; True.   \nSame in USA. When interest rates were down. Lots of companies/investors started new projects that resulted in mass hiring. Now that interest rates are higher. There has been a never ending wave of layoffs.; I don't think Canada ever had a stronger tech market than Germany 😬"

   "Top Comments": "One issue with people failing the hiring manager round is that they emit strong \"unpredictable guy\" vibes. \n\nRemember, any organization wants someone who is easy to work with and predictable. When asked about \"what would you do in x situation,\" your first answer should always be \"I'll inform my manager.\"; Don't take it personally. They're probably interviewing 20 managers for every position that's available. \n\nJob hunting is a numbers game. If you take each individual interview personally, you'll never survive because it's tough out there. If you did your best, then just chalk it up to someone might have been slightly better or they have more relevant experience.; One common cause of this is if you're focused on just the technical aspects to your answers, and get too caught up in the fine details, and fail to recognize what the interviewer is looking to actually learn about you. \n\nFor example, asking about a challenge you've faced is often as much or more about how you approach challenges and what you learned from the process than it is about communicating the actual details of one particular issue. \n\nYou may benefit from doing some mock behavioral interviews when someone experienced so you can get some unfiltered feedback about what's not working.; Unless they literally tell you why or you made an obvious fuck up, you could have been passed up for any reason possibly even out of your control. Theres no point worrying about it tbh.; I would highly suggest discreetly recording these calls so you can play them back and review what you did wrong and right.; lol; Yeah, I've noticed this.  I've slightly adjusted my answers to be less in-the-weeds technically, and I noticed the response rate seemed to be better once I started tweaking that.\n\nBut this company I just interviewed at, asked me \"tell me about a time you designed a distributed system\", which... didn't really make sense in the context of a hiring manager behavioral interview.  It was hard for me to understand what they were looking for there.\n\nTypically, I get questions about mentorship, conflict, etc.  But this one, I couldn't decipher what he wanted to glean out of that; I see why you’re getting rejected; lol; This literally got me my current job, saying this exact phrase got a thumbs up from the senior dev. Also tell them you have other interviews with XYZ companies even if it isn't true.; lol; Haha \n\nI feel like everyone should actually put flairs on their profile.  I can see why people like /u/DunnoWhatKek and /u/kdot38 post here instead of /r/ExperiencedDevs -- you can pretend to know what you're talking about to a bunch of newgrads lol.\n\nI'm in the wrong sub; Bruh, you asked why you aren’t passing the HM interview, and I kindly gave you a perspective. Why are you getting so defensive?\n\nHM rounds are mainly vibe check. Most of the HM doesn’t give a jack shit you answered questions in STAR format or not.; Yeah OP is tilted for no reason. I thought it was rude that you gave meaningful advice and their response to feedback is lol. Agreed that an HM round really is just “vibe check”, culture fit, and showing enthusiasm for a role."

   "Title": "How do I subtly tell my manager coworker I am working with is fu*kin stupid? ",
   "Top Comments": "A word of warning: While I think it is important to discuss this guy with your manager, be cautious about how you bring him up, because you may not know why this guy still has a job at your company. For example, maybe someone at the company has personal connections with him — like some other manager's son or cousin or something. If you piss them off, then you might get screwed. Not saying it is fair for anyone to retaliate when the guy is clearly inept, but that doesn't mean they won't. And then all of a sudden, you're fired for some BS, made-up reason.\n\nPersonally, I would act concerned and not angry, as to avoid conflict. Just say something like, \"hey, Joe and I have been working on this project for a little while, but i think Joe needs some help with XYZ. I have been trying to help him lately, but I unfortunately have a lot of work to do and meetings to attend, so I cannot help him as much as I would like to. Is there someone you can find to help him?\" Then show screenshots (or even do a screen share over video chat) of him asking you to do the work for him, etc.; I tend to be defensive of bad coders, because a bad coder can become a good one with some guidance but asking for you to send them code so they can pass it off as their own is a ... Very bad thing. That's a pretty bad red flag. \n\nTalk to your manager, tell them. \"hey I noticed this person isn't delivering their share, I'm concerned about their ability to keep up\", and if they play it off then you tell them this person is asking for code to deceive your manager as to their own progress.; Everyone\\* applying to 5k jobs while reading about people employed and don't know For Loops...; 1. They already know \n2. This is a learning opportunity tbh to teach, mentor, and guide (bc idk ur current position but you will deal with incompetent people anywhere, required to mentor new grad one day, or just manage people, etc); >Today they legit asked me if I can finish the part they are struggling with for them and send them the code through slack\n\nYou don't need to be very subtle in this case.  If they asked this via slack, show your manager a screenshot of the conversation.  If they asked in person, just tell the manager that it's happening. \n\nDon't deliver any work to this person in secret.  If you decide to help them with anything, make sure that happens in writing.; Have a guy at my job who hasn't done jack shit since I've been there, 4ish years. He's been here 20. I spent my first 2 years doing his work and keeping my mouth shut.  I just assumed he was really incompetent. Well he is incompetent, but only because he has never tried. All his effort goes into appearing to work. This guy is on every single one of my projects. Has taken credit for my work and slowed down all of my projects. I started subtley mentioning it to my manager in a concerned way. Now not so subtle. Still nothing has been done. No moral of the story, other than make sure you aren't being taken advantage of.; As a f\\*ckin stupid person, tell me directly and explain why.  It would help.  You can still fire me but at least I'll know why.; Been having the exact same situation happening for the past few months. We took on a person that blatantly lied about experience. Since then he’s been picking up tickets not being able to finish up nothing but simple tasks like adding a new field here and there.\n\nHe lacks basic knowledge and understanding of concepts and struggles even with the most core things.\n\nPeople say that your mention of a for loop is a hyperbole, but trust me I have seen a lambda based for loop that uses a manually incrementing counter…so yeah…\n\nPersonally, I would speak up. A person like this cannot be saved and frankly is nothing but an impediment to the team and the processes. Adding to this mix, behaviors like asking you to their work (something I have experienced) and you have a recipe for disaster. I say screw them. There are plenty of good developers that for some reason are out of work that can easily fulfill a position and perform, so why keep on someone who’s a waste of time and effort?\n\nP.S: for those advocating for bad developers; I’ve been working on this field for 10+ years now. I have seen bad devs that with the correct approach and proper mentoring made outstanding turnarounds.\n\nHowever, what I am seeing lately is an influx of people that I can only call scammers. Highly unmotivated and severely lacking in knowledge often behaving badly and in an entitled way, simply in this field for the money. I think that’s one of the worst byproducts of the COVID period…; so, what type of peer feedback/mentoring framework does your company use? the more formal/less personal you can make this the better. \n\nSBI- Situation/bevhior/impact is a good framework to google how to describe bad actions and their impact in a neutral tone. the more specific you can be, and the more verifiable you can be (eg a third person saw it too, chat logs, email, pull requests) the better. Managers dont care (and cant really act upon) drama, but they do care about documented poor performance. talk to your manager about this openly, in 1on1s, email, slack whatever. \n\nFeel free to give people like this firm but fair feedback about their gaps in the future. but once they're just asking for code to pass off on their own, thats a red line. give direct feedback around \"this is something you need to be able to do\" and loop in manager.; I would advise against going to the manager. Just say you were busy and don't help him. He will learn or find someone else to leech off of. Not your problem.; If your job is on the line, just be forward and honest, using screenshots of any communication you’ve had. If it’s only their job on the line, I wouldn’t do anything to jeopardize their job. You could try and help them or at least propose to your lead how there is room for this person to grow. But don’t do anything that gets them fired, that’s extremely cruel in this economy, especially since the market is shit and most people can’t get good insurance UNLESS they are at a full time job; I would tell your manager of course. If they persist in asking just tell them that you have spoken with your manager and will not be writing code for them. Of course be nice and help them if they are just stuck a bit, but it isn’t your job to educate them. Plenty of competent grads who would fill their shoes nicely; That thing about a for loop sounds like hyperbole. So much so that I really doubt if this whole story is true.\n\nPeople seem a little desperate to prove other people are idiots so they can seem competent maybe. ; nothing will happen if you rat, best thing to do is to not help them, let management figure it out themselves.; If your boss subscribes to wall street bets, just refer to your coworker as highly regarded. He'll get the hint.; You don't. Everyone knows.; 1. Don't panic  \n2. Ask yourself if they are just going through something challenging or are they just not doing the work? If you're 100% that they are no doing the work and not coachable, which it seems, go to your manager and explain the situation. \n\n3. Be prepared to have to do the rest of the work; You don’t tell him. Play nice and that guy will get weeded out eventually. Sitting around and hunting for dummies isn’t great for your career; That's a good way to frame it thanks.; Not knowing how to write a forloop in a language that is in your job description is something you should defend ?

   "Top Comments": "These are things are what helped me get a job:\n\n1) Leetcode. go through the neetcode 150 list, do the problem of the day, then get into contests.  \n2) Systems Design practice. There's a format that's expected, and it really helps if you know it.  \n3) Behavioral. Go through the 30 most common interview questions, and write out your responses in STAR format.  \n4) Full stack application. I had a \"craft\" interview, and it really helped that I was building something at the time.  \n5) Reading group for academic CS papers.\n\nLearning new skills can be wrapped up in your project, but make sure it has some viable end goal, ideally distribution to people who will use to solve a problem. This one is definitely a rabbit hole, and you can probably skip it. Finally, skip certs entirely. They won't help you get a SWE job.\n\nI don't really count the networking or applying to jobs part, and although I did both of those, it's a minority of time. One strategy that worked for me, is identifying companies around me that I have a compelling reason to work with: like I understand what they do, or like the problem. For those, spend the time and write a cover letter, it will help.\n\nIf you take that list and start working on it, you'll see that there are more things to do and get good at then there is time. Therefore, the approach I like is to do interview prep like it's my full time job, and set the priorities to cover everything, then work on my identified weaknesses.\n\nGood luck!; Cut your list down to:  \n   \n1. Leetcode  \n2. Applying to jobs (Check often, being first helps a lot)   \n3. Behavioral Prep (Practice telling stories in STAR format that match  common interview questions)  \n4. Polishing Resume   \n5. Practice System Design   \n----BIG GAP----   \n6. Attending networking events or career fairs and workshops   \n7. Reaching out to recruiters/connections\n\nRecruiters generally don't care about experience from personal projects unless it's something spectacular, and even then they won't check it a lot of the time. Usually they will want either specific skills you've used in internships, or just to see that you seem like you've done good work and can learn new skills.; I wish so bad leetcode wasn't at the top of your list, but you're absolutely right.; I like this framework. Two changes I would make - there is no point in studying if you are not getting interviews. And 2, you only need new projects if you are hearing that you do not have enough \"experience\" on your resume. Obviously, there is no way for you to get more experience at an actual workplace (that would be best) so a personal project will have to suffice.; They have lots of internship experience so they should be ok"

The two notable instances, I had an initial call, the recruiters tell me they'll pass the resume around, I wait, and then after asking about updates, am told the role I was applying for was filled already.\n\n2) Recruiters themselves haven't been \"on the ball\". With Amazon in particular, they just couldn't figure out how to properly get my resume in front of people / work with managers to actually talk to me. I talk to one recruiter on an email message chain 15 replies long, who passes me off to another recruiter, who CCs a hiring manager, asking for my availability. I enter availability and the hiring manager tells me they can't make the meeting on the days I selected. Recruiter 2 follows up in a separate email chain, I enter availability again, and then don't hear anything back. I end up missing a meeting because no one confirmed with me, and recruiter 1 cites the confirmation on the first accepted meeting, which was canceled.... it was a fucking mess, man. I've never embodied a \"Hands in the air, fuck it\" attitude with the job search so far, but that one had me questioning my sanity.\n\nNow I want to say, I don't blame the recruiters for this. I imagine that if things are this chaotic on the outside, that it's even worse on the inside. So no disparagement against the recruiters themselves, but man, their processes are fucking mind numbingly stupid.; I'm in a similar boat except the recruiter actually told the job no longer existed, it was the same day as the move to Mexico announcement. I suspect that is what is happening here and I just got lucky with the recruiter; congratulations! You helped them import another cheap H1B !!!

Thanks in advance.; Would you say that you got a 100k job with your 3.0 because of the additional efforts you made? How many projects did you create/internships did you have?; For someone going into CS, my brother is honestly incredibly sociable. Captain of his football team, multi sport athlete, but huge nerd also. He knows how to make a good impression and certainly keep his grades up. Every once in a while though he tends to get a bit ‘comfortable’ and not take schoolwork as serious, but I just attribute that to him fucking around in highschool. Kids should have the opportunity to mess up every now and then. Keeps them humble I think. Mind you he still finished high school with anywhere from a 3.5-3.8 GPA (dependent on how final grades turn out) so I’m hopeful that as he enters college, he really takes this opportunity serious. I believe he will and knows he has it in him. I guess this is just older brother helicoptering lol; No idea, but the internship is going to matter more than a GPA. Work experience, not grades"

The fact that you at least got 5 interviews with just 1YOE and no target degree shows that there may still be opportunity for OP. IMO, it'll be easier to switch if you are employed. If unemployed, harder if you don't have immediately portable skills maybe.; I'm just curious if its easier, like how many rejections you got compared to no experience; no it wasn't 5 interviews, it was 5 email rejections from the start.; Last year when I got hired I had 1.5 years experience in an internship that turned into a full offer but I smoked pot and lost it (made up a reason why I turned it down) just apply to things close to your experience, tune your resume to the jobs, study hard for interviews. I applied to maybe 20 places, got 3 interviews, one offer. Job market was much better and I had a really good internship (Bosch).

   "Top Comments": "It's not legal for your employer to withhold pay from hourly workers due to server outages. According to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employees must be compensated for all hours worked, including time spent waiting for work-related tasks, such as waiting for servers to come back online. You may want to reach out to your HR department; >I'm still here at my desk waiting for the servers to come up. I still have to attend meetings on teams when they happen\n\nNope, not legal in this case. If you are at work/attending meetings, they are required to compensate you for those hours.; No. You are being paid for putting your life on pause to do the bidding of some rich guy. So basically anything you are doing where you could otherwise be living your normal life is to be paid for.; A brief note to your state Labor Board will stop this nonsense once and for all.; If they're requiring you to be at your desk and attend meetings even with the servers down, they have to pay you for that time. If it was \"hey, servers are down, we'll let you know when they're back, and we won't pay until you're able to work\" sitting at your desk expecting to be paid would be silly - enjoy the break.; This is not legal. You are at the office during normal work hours on schedule and performing work duties. ; If you’re required to be available, you’re required to be paid. But it is possible they could reduce the hours you’re required to be available, and thus pay less.; If you’re expected to come in and attend meetings, you are working.; Submit your hours as you normally would. If your supervisor doesn’t approve then you would have cause for legal action. He might avoid trouble and approve your hours after some grumbling.; Sounds highly illegal.  If they are not paying you while you are at work for your given schedule, I’d kindly remind them that your time isn’t free.  Nice lawsuit for your bank account.; If your employer is requiring you to be at work it’s illegal.; What kind of rinky dink company are you guys working for where not only there are 72+ hour server outages but they try not to pay you for them? Find a new job honestly, I’ve never seen anything like this.; If they told you that your are off work and go have fun then yes. If you attending meetings you are working ; [removed]; No, they should pay you, since the issue is their fault not yours.\n\nIs it legal?  Unfortunately, the only answer is \"ask a lawyer\".  The outcome varies based on where you live, country, and even by state in the US.; If you are required to still attend meetings and still expected to be ready, then you must be paid.; Your employer is required to pay you two hours of reporting time pay. This is if they tell you you are off the rest of the day, but I wouldn't stick around at a place that treats you like that when the market is better.; > I still have to attend meetings on teams when they happen. This can't be legal can it? I'm in the US.\n\nNo, not legal. Anything you are required to do is for work is 'work' and you have to be paid for it.\n\nBut you're also being foolish if you put up with it. I would get it in writing when things like this happen.; Contact your state labor department.; I doubt it, but if it's a one time thing TBH I probably wouldn't make a stink about it. If it happens again, that's another story.\n\nFWIW, I used to work in the QA department at a factory. When the line went down there was nothing to do, but I absolutely got paid."

Yes, you should obviously NOT accept lowball salaries like $30,000 USD, but you know what I mean.\n\nJust research what the current market rate is for your YOE and skill set. Then determine an ideal TC and be willing to take less if needed. I mean, you should always look at market rate and try to avoid making comparisons to your old TC, especially if your old TC was abnormally high. This is because employers have the upper hand when you're jobless.\n\nBtw, it may help to interview at multiple places at once so that you can weigh your options, so maybe apply at the same time to multiple companies.; Compensation can vary greatly depending on company and location, so you \"determine\" it by deciding what you're willing to accept and see if companies can meet that.; You can expect whatever you want.

But with 10 years experience $125k/year is still pretty low even for the midwest.\n\nIs making $150k/year+ and having loads of stress, being in a hybrid situation or dreadful full time in the office, with terrible management worth it?  I guess only you know the answer to that.\n\nIf your management is reasonable ask for a bump and bring proof you are underpaid, or quiet quit and start applying to test the market.; I thought you were going to say $100k, even that would have been low. \n\n$75k is likely in the bottom 10% for 10 years of experience. \n\nJob hop for a big raise.; wow you are underpaid, current market is trash but even in this market you are underpaid; That's a junior dev salary to start, that company doesn't respect you and are taking advantage of you.; You might actually have some luck approaching the situation with your manager or skip level manager since you are quite a bit below market for your experience level. You should be able to find average wages in your area (levels.fyi, payscale, glassdoor) and I suspect they are at least $100k. \n\nWrite an email asking for a raise, explain that you love working for xyz company and you want to continue your career there but you are concerned that you are falling behind significantly in salary and may be forced to change positions if you can't get closer to the market wage. Ask for $120k or whatever you are seeing as average (go a bit higher), explain what you are seeing in the market for average wages, list out some of your accomplishments over the years ideally with dollar figures (I performed x project which saved the company $500k over 2 years, I performed x project which I estimate if outsourced would have cost the company $400k, anything with hard numbers where you saved money would be great). The purpose of this is to give your manager the justification they need to give you a raise.\n\nYou might broach the subject with your manager first, explain how you have friends/family that are seeing much higher wages to feel things out, some managers could take this badly, you'd know the best.; I stopped reading at 75k. Please quiet quit and find another job. I have 2 years of experience and I am at 80k and I still hate my current company. I couldn't imagine having 10 years of experience and making 75k at my current company. \n\nGive them the BARE minimum. Do not answer your phone on time off unless it is a DIRE emergency, like the business is losing millions because of a server issue or something. 75k is beyond insulting for that amount of experience.; In a small firm, you CAN push for an adjustment.\n\nIn a larger firm.  Ask about an adjustment \"in band\".  They may be able to bump you a good bit, depending on if you've been promoted, or not etc.\n\nAsk questions, and gather information before making asks.  You may literally shame the person you are asking into giving you a raise.; Stop crying and start applying?; I think you're grossly underpaid. I have about 5 years of experience, and even when I started I was making more than double what you are getting. However, I've also only worked in VHCOL (Bay/Seattle/NYC) areas and large tech companies.; Feels like you're making 30-50% of what I would expect. But depends on how good you are and what markets etc...; I’ve been at my company for three years and I make over 30k more per year than when I started. I got there by asking for it. And when it started to stagnate, I got another job offer that my company really didn’t want me to take. So they made me a manager and bumped my pay more. Plus more bonus. \n\nAt this point, you have probably made yourself a lynchpin. You leaving would be very expensive. \n\nStart interviewing elsewhere and send a strongly worded email demanding a pay adjustment. Let them know of everything that you’ve managed, built, and actively maintain. Ideally, point out places where no other employee has the skills to keep something from breaking. \nAlso, finish by telling them that an equivalent software engineer to replace you would cost close to 120k (or whatever it is in your area). Or they can settle for a college grad they have to spend a decade training, if he even stays that long. \nIf you’re critical to your company’s success, act like it.; 75 k wtf I was making 60k straight out of college a few years ago, probably the same as you when adjusted for inflation; You’re supposed to job hop every 2 or 3 years.; Look, raises aren't really a thing in real life.  The only way you really get a raise is by job hopping.  Anyone who stays at their first employer will get the same low pay as you have.  That's how things work.; There are other jobs.;  Bro , companies don’t have any incentive to give you higher pay. 10 years at the same company? No way. Jump ship often giving yourself a raise.; Dude I’m self-taught, 2.5 yoe, work at a no-name trucking company in low cost of living and make 100k. Start applying.; Some places don’t pay well. Don’t take it so personally. They know they don’t pay well. Leadership probably can’t get more money even though they want it. I think your only mistake is internalizing this so much. Your salary is a line item on a budget sheet. It’s not a reflection of your worth. You might get a 7.5k bump if everything goes well. You’ll still have this thought in your head. If things don’t go well, you’ll stay at the same salary, and you’ll silk think you’re under paid, and you’ll be wondering if you can make it anywhere else. \n\nPersonally, I’d lose the safety net, and jump ship. ; If you’re interested in staying remote, check out [levels.fyi/remote](https://levels.fyi/remote). Although way less than Covid era, there are still a lot of companies that are 100% remote, and with 10 yoe you could probably make at least 150-175k base, plus equity and maybe bonus. You should definitely brush up on leetcode and system design problems before interviewing if you haven’t interviewed in a long time - interviewing well is its own skill and unfortunately in my experience, being good as a senior swe doesn’t automatically map up to being a good interviewer for swe roles"

   "Title": "Feeling so stressed since lead engineer left",
   "Top Comments": ">I've been working super late and on the weekends to try to fix things and am failing so miserably at it\n\nDon't do this. This is why you're burning out.\n\nNot the fact your lead engineer left, not the fact there's a bunch of knowledge gaps in the codebase, but rather how you're *reacting* to all of that.\n\nProductivity drops when engineers leave, especially when it's lead engineers that had a bunch of magic business logic tucked away in their head. You don't have to compensate for that drop in productivity, just let it happen. Companies know this happens, they know things will take longer, they know there's massive gaps that engineers have to re-learn from scratch.\n\nTake it one day at a time. This thing you've been trying to fix *takes time to fix*. That's normal. Work your regular 9-5, M-F. Fix what you can during those hours, learn what you can during those hours, and then at 5pm sharp every day *stop thinking about work*. Leave your work problems at the door.\n\nThis is advice not just for now, but for your entire career. It's how you avoid burnout. More times than not all of this stress is entirely self-inflicted. You're imagining if you don't do this you're going to get fired. That's not the case. You may think it is, but I promise you it's not.\n\nTry stopping work at 5pm today, and starting at 9am tomorrow and see how you feel. Then keep doing that. Don't work this Saturday or Sunday. See how you feel after a refreshing weekend on Monday.; At the end of the day, I guarantee you're not getting paid enough for the level of emotional investment to the company you have -- it's not your job to save the company from their mistakes of putting too much weight onto a single engineer then letting that engineer leave.\n\nLearning to compartmentalize your attachment to work is an important skill, especially in the land of startups. I worked at a small startup for a year (5 engineers) and learned this lesson the hard way myself, you have to come to terms with the fact that the company's trajectory or performance is not a reflection of your worth; put in the work you're capable of at the hours you're comfortable with and let what happens happens.\n\nIf you don't have a significant stake in the company then it's just. not. worth. it.; Sounds like a great time to ask for a raise.; Don't get too attached to code. This is managements problem to solve, not yours.; When this started happening at my old company, us group of juniors were all hands on deck working crazy hours... But then realised eventually that it happens to the company every so often where a bunch of qualified engineers leave, so they were hoping for us to do overtime instead of them replacing the expensive engineers. That's how they kept their costs low 🙄 so we all started doing exactly what we were supposed to from 07:00 to 16:00, took our lunch and all our breaks, and went to grab drinks at 16:05 at a local pub. Morale increased and I started loving tech again. In the sprints we would just say that we are busy, here are what we are struggling with and that engineer x y and z had the answers but we are still investigating. 🤷🏼‍♂️ it wasn't like they were going to fire the last few guys that actually slightly have a clue.; Do what you can, and if some work doesn't get done until your lead is backfilled, so be it. Communicate this to your manager as well, and spend some time learning rather than just doing feature work. I have an epic set up for myself where I add continuing development and education goals as tickets, and I make notes on those tickets as I go. During performance reviews, I pull up the epic as part of the discussion about what I did over the past year. It'll feel like you're less productive at first, but having time budgeted for learning will tremendously improve your skills and make you a more effective engineer the longer you do it.; lol yep i was the first one to write documentation oretty much\n\n\ni inherited a project from an ex $boogteetch team, where everybody had already peaced out during the acquisition. learned a fuckton. got to work with all the latest everythings. avgd probably 14-16hours of work for several years, got really good at what I do, ran for president, which was surprisingly easier than hitting top 8 in my regional ssbm rankings; You can look at it as a signal. He knows more than you (he has more experience than you, that's why he's lead engineer, also he sees things from a different place - probably he understands the whole business).\n\nSo maybe that's the signal that the startup is failing. If he left, maybe you should leave too.; We had a major dev shown the door and ever since I’ve had to default into a lot of his code. But I still don’t work nights or weekends. Tough luck people who let him go.; What country is this?; i have been in this position with a mission critical ball of mud, taking over the lead role. i learned the stack, learned the processes, politicked with the stakeholders and mentored the devs. eventually i told them pay me or I'm gone, they paid me then immediately started doing everything they could to make the whole thing less dependent on me which led to less burnout. they had no choice but to pay me, and the smart move was removing my leverage, not all organizations will respond like that to a threat. moved up the ladder and onto other projects a year later, the responsibilities and stakes are higher but I've adjusted.; 1. don't panic\n\n2. if you try and overwork to solve it where there are not enough people you will also leave. Remind yourself that after 30 hours of work a week most people can't code more effectively. \n\n3. Is there any possible help that you can call on for the items you are not able to fix or any chance to have the lead work as a consultant to hand off to you ?; failure of leadership, don’t work more than 40 and let them fix their own business; \"Has anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do?\"\n\nThis is the opposite side to the argument of job hopping and moving place every year or so, someone has to take on the old code and deal with it, you in this case. \n\nYou want to be the one writing the new code , not dealing with this. That would be my tip. A fresh startup for example.\n\nAlternatively when interviewing for your next job ask questions about average tenure , staff turnover etc. Being somewhere with high staff retention sounds like it might be something you'd like more. \n\nOther than that look at the FI/RE movement. Suck it up , save as much as you can and try to get out of this system.; 100% this, set boundaries or you will burn out.; There is a smal cahcne they will fire you; doing that is a dumb emotional responde on their part, and you don't want to work here anyway, as places that do that go under eventually.; You're totally right, thank you for reminding me of this. It's difficult to keep it in mind when shit suddenly hits the fan!; I had to take a screenshot of this reply for myself; +1\n\n\nAlso, if you want more peace of mind write a TODO list for the next day at the end of each work-day.; I would also add that if you work long unsustainable hours at software development you end up setting a new baseline that you will be judged against.   It’s often times counter productive to your career growth unless you’re rewarded directly for it."

We received a $24 million valuation for a seed round of funding. 4 months later and at the very first sign of any financial turmoil in the company, they laid me off. No loyalty.\n\nProceeded to apply for jobs for the next two years, filling out over 400 applications and only receiving a handful of interviews (my wife is a top tier recruiter and HR professional, it’s not a resume issue), I still do not have job. I turned down one offer that was below the starting salary of my first job out of college (13 years ago).\n\nI had to start my own business to try to make ends meet and have been put in financial struggles for the last two years. My college degree and eleven years of real work experience means nothing to corporate America or even local startups.\n\nSo to answer your question, I’m doing awful. I’m depressed, tired, poor, and have to put a smile on my face everyday so my kids don’t know how shitty life really is.; I was laid off at the end of 2022.\n\nThat was around that first wave where all big companies were doing it. I was on a visa and had to find something quickly. I managed to do it and accepted the first (and only) offer I got, which I took a big pay cut and ended up being one of the worst jobs I've ever worked, but at least I had a job.\n\nI stayed there for about a year, waited a bit and then started interviewing again.

They litterally scheduled a call,I joined, and they said you are done immediately, got locked out of everything and was kicked to the curb all in the same day.

Already redid my resume and made a few versions to test the waters.

Only getting responses for recruiters who are hoping I'm their golden ticket despite not submitting me to roles I'm ACTUALLY a fit for. Everywhere else is a ghost job posting, hard ignore, not enough relevant experience, etc.\n\nThe criteria for qualifications has multiplied tremendously. I don't know what others are experiencing, but I find that they want senior architecture level knowledge and experience even for a junior level role. One job I got far in told me that \"we don't want a guru, just enough about APIs\". Apparently I knew everything except I wasn't certified in Azure Cloud Administration, and that was a hard reject for \"not a good fit\" despite it being listed as a \"nice to have\".  \n\nF\\*\\*k the job market, it truly is unfair.; I've been fed up with my job for about 8 months or so now, but only really hit the Leetcode about a month and a half ago. I am in the process of getting an offer right now, though I think they're trying to lowball me, which, given I'm still employed means I might just stay where I am, but just wanted to say that the market does seem to be turning around in terms of openings from where it was 8 months ago. It did take longer than last time to get my first offer, but as long as you're up to speed on some leetcode easy's, some easy mediums, able to reason through some systems design stuff, and have some good answers to standard STAR questions, I think you'll be alright.; Was apart of mass firings in early jan, only had 10 months of xp.  After 400 apps, 7 interview loops, I got an offer due to being the only one able to debug and correct a .net service, including \"senior\" candidates. I'm starting my third week.\n\n60k base,\n,Old private insurance company\n,Hybrid 2 days in office\n,Super lax and flexible\n,26 people total in It dept\n,Mostly everyone is really old, they were using punch cards in their college days.\n,vLcol city\n,Super stable, never had layoffs in the 100 years here.

At least that's what it seems when talking about my future projects with my manager.\n\nAlthough I'm grateful for this job, I do wish I got paid more. I thought I'd be saving more than what I currently can.\n\nI do recognize how lucky I've been in job search. 600 apps for 2022 internship, 300 for newgrad, and 400 for current.; Got laid off about a month ago. I’m getting all sorts of weird signals from recruiters. 18 years of experience without being a manager is a red flag from 2 of them. Companies want you to have 100% of their requirements to even have a conversation with you. 1 recruiter told me that they only look to hire people who are employed because being laid off is likely your fault. Another told me that it’s at least 6 months to find a job. Yet another told me that if you are out more than 6 months, you aren’t worth talking to. In short, it’s a mess; This is why under no problem conditions should employees be loyal to companies. Companies these days are just hot garbage. They expect you to give a formal two weeks notice but then turn around and do this shit? Fuck em; Hey, I'm sorry to hear about this. The job market for seniors in major tech centers is good, albeit for in-person and hybrid work, not remote (I can't really speak to the remote  market, so it might be fine, I dunno).\n\nHow many years of experience do you have?; Same here almost 2 weeks ago, with 4 YOE at a small no-name startup. Applying like crazy, unemployment insurance is meager here (HCOL area), and hardly any callbacks.\n\n\nI suggest you get cracking on submitting apps. You may have better luck than me though. It's rough.; I was laid off last May, and it took me about 4 months to find a new gig. I lucked out and it was a decent pay bump and way better job. \n\nTake a few days 'off' and decompress. Then set up a plan of attack. The role I was laid off from was a C# desktop app, so I really wanted to upskill into more modern frameworks, so I studied up on React/TS/express and AWS/Azure. \n\nIt's hard, but also try and enjoy the time off as well. It's (hopefully) not often that you'll get time off as an adult. To look on the bright side, it also sucks working 50 hours every week for 10 years and not get to enjoy life.; Yea not great - been 2 months. Of course I haven't been able to dedicate 100% of my time to job hunting with some personal stuff that's going on at the moment.  But it sucks.  I go through waves of \"what did I do wrong?\"   \n\"what could I have done differently?\" etc etc.; I know the feeling. I would suggest the Layoff sub. \n\nThe good part for you is that the market is slightly picking up over the last week or so. I've had more recruiters contact me in the past week then in the previous 2 months. \n\nAlso of note. This is not your fault. You did nothing wrong. It will get better. I know I went through a wide array of feelings when it happened to me. \n\nRemember to put in your unemployment request this week. Start working on leetcode if you haven't already.; I got laid off in December and then in January had a biopsy where they found cancer (I had completed cancer treatment last year so not blindsided but was not happy to have another neck surgery), had my surgery in February, started applying in March and signed something almost two weeks ago! I start in June. I had less trouble getting interviews this time compared to previous job searches, but the interviews were more variable. A lot of companies asking weirder questions, and also a lot of “we filled this position” situations. It’s a challenge but there are lots of roles out there.; Sorry you were laid off. Mine happened last year but I'm good now and you will as well; Same thing happened to me over a year ago… I’m thinking about leaving tech at this point.; Hi. Here for you. Make sure you apply for unemployment ASAP. Even with severance you get it when you get laid off so it will help cushion you a bit. This process can take a while so just knock it out. Feel free to DM if you need any help or someone to chat."

   "Title": "C-level execs wants engineers to broadcast our “failures” to learn from them. What is a good argument against it?",
   "Top Comments": "companies normally do it via post mortem documents; There isn't a good argument against this. This is a best practice.; >I’d love some advice on a good rebuttal that won’t get me fired or have a target on my back.\n\nI'm confused why you jump to assuming this is a bad thing. It sounds like company leadership wants to understand how your department is handling failures, and also want to make sure that you all are having some kind of discussion about it in the first place. I hate to side with the C-suite on anything, but this all sounds perfectly reasonable. Especially where this is apparently the standard practice for other departments.; Another way to think about it, is that your failures are already often being broadcast.  Every time an outraged customer calls support about a bug, every time there's an outage, etc, the rest of the company takes note.  If that's all they hear, they'll form a negative opinion of you and your team.  Tell them about the time your test processes or monitoring caught a bug before any customer caught it.  Tell them just how difficult that critical customer issue was, and the phenomenal work your team did to address it in a timely manner.  \n\nAt a minimum, when you do post mortems internally, part of the process should be to make a document you can share with the rest of the company describing the issue and the plan to prevent it from happening in the future.  \n\n\n\nYou can and should also use this format to broadcast your team's success.  If you spend a bunch of time on performance improvements, let the company know just how much better performance got.  Tell them about the big refactoring project you did and highlight how it'll make maintenance faster in the future, or will enable you to build certain features that are upcoming on the roadmap, etc.; Lean into it.  But make sure to spin your \"failures\" in the best light possible.  A blameless \"if we had known about X sooner, we could have sidestepped bad outcome Y\" makes you seem better, not worse.  If you're talking to the whole company, you can use that forum to lobby for changes that you need to improve as well.; There is no CTO and a single engineering team with one manager? Weird company structure. Anyway, specifics of tech issues are useless for anyone outside the tech team. If the CEO and CFO want to be more in the loop, then that's what the engineering manager should be doing. The common practice is a post-mortem, which is not technical in nature and is not intended to be directly written to the c-suite. Your manager should be reviewing the results of that with the CTO, and the CTO should review that with the rest of the c-suite. But that's for real issues... things which hurt the bottom line or reputational loss. Nobody needs to be updated when engineer A puts in a NPE that momentarily floods your logs and nobody externally notices.\n\n\nEdit: leaning towards a culture where everyone is under a microscope is unnecessarily hostile. If I had to notify my company of every minor issue that impacts nobody, I'd probably find a new job.; Its a mixed bag.\n\nThe big fear with this is that this information will be used more to drive different incentives. Depending on how the C-level or other employees actually react to this information it can cause stress or dread to the development team. Like if its publicized is it now an open form for everyone to criticize? It makes sense to talk about this stuff with CTO but everyone can be very off putting.\n\nOtherwise its sounds like a good thing, that can quickly dissolve into micro-management/very toxic structure.; Make it incredibly technical, because most bugs are. They will lose interest very quickly. Some bugs based on flawed processes might be helpful to do an official post mortem, but doing it this way seems artificial and silly.; This is just standard practice. You should be having these discussions with your team on a regular basis. My team does it after every sprint where we retrospect on what went well and what went wrong and then working to implement changes so the wrongs are less likely to happen again. This is a good thing.\n\nFrom here it should be up to your manager to communicate what went well and major things that went wrong with stakeholders, in this case the c-suite.\n\nThis sounds like a non-issue as long as they aren't weaponizing  it against employees. If they do, it's a culture issue and trying to stop one policy change isn't going to fix a bad culture.; don't argue with the C-level it just annoys them. They don't want you to argue, they want you to do as asked.\n\n  \nJust smile and nod and tell them how correct and awesome they are, and then game the system.\n\n  \nBut yeah blameless retrospectives are pretty normal; As others have said this is a good thing to retro actual failures. But to play devils advocate. \n\nEven the best practices can be used for evil if the intent is there. If you have leadership that is not technically literate and looking for an easier way to point fingers and blame individuals rather than process or practice then it’s a bad thing.\n\nI have seen leadership in non technical companies doing more scapegoating than analysis on their crappy setup for why stuff goes wrong.\n\nSo in terms of how this is done try to influence the setup in a way that focuses on process and setup failure.; You all don’t don’t any type of RCA after a failure? If so you need to start.; sounds like they're upset with the failures of middle management.\n\nif you have process improvement ideas, this is your chance to put them forward.\n\notherwise i would ask for clarification in terms of how much time and energy you individually should be spending on reporting, what expected deliverables there are, and what audience(s) those deliverables are intended for. this would also be your time to talk about what you might suggest toward that end (e.g. a weekly status report from eveey team member to skip manager or c-suite) but really this type of shit is why you have middle management in the first place.; Have you never heard of a post mortem? Failures, followed by their fixes or suggested fixes are a great way to get upper levels to rubber stamp cleaning work that would have otherwise been denied in the constant agile churn of today.; It would be better to frame this as positives and negatives. Here are the things we did (aren't they awesome?) here are some lessons learned (aren't they awesome?)\n\n\"We had a database go down and it had no monitoring so we added monitoring\"\n\nProbably what execs call a \"shit sandwich\". Just listing failures doesn't sound fun.; I don’t think there’s enough context in your post for us to say whether this is good or bad and advise you. However I will say: \n\n- Blameless postmortems are common at larger companies. Although I think the discussions usually stay within the engineering org\n- Having worked at several startups, C-levels suddenly firing engineering management and getting more “hands on” is always a bad sign. Good luck! Remember, at small companies, optics are everything; Are there mistakes highlighted to the whole org?; We have bi-weekly incident review meetings where we go over outages and emergencies as the whole engineering department and figure out what we can do better.  They're *insanely* useful because we're very supportive of a blameless culture.; Why look at it as a bad thing? There are plenty of upsides to airing your dirty laundry; it's more about how these things are implemented. We used to do weekly meetings about what we learned (good or bad) to share with teammates.; Post mortems / rcca’s aren’t already available to other departments?"

   "Title": "What are the fundamentals?",
   "Top Comments": "For the open-ended questions (less technically specific ones), answering them just comes with experience. There is no 100% correct answer, and trying to memorize a textbook response will hurt you instead\n\n>\"if a user told you your application was slow how would you troubleshoot it\"\n\nTake this question for example, you could start with:\n\n* Identifying and debugging bottlenecks with your app\n* Gathering more context on the scenario first — see [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)\n* Ignoring the user if your app is a PC game. [Don't optimize it](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/16ffymf/whats_the_deal_with_all_these_unoptimized_pc/) and just tell the user to buy a bigger computer; Good to see somebody using the term fundamentals to referr to foundamental fundementals and not leetcode fundamentals; In my opinion, these aren't fundamentals.  They are just trivia.  SWEs come into an employer and the use of docker vs virtual machine, SQL versus noSQL is set in stone years before.  Most SWEs aren't going to know this naturally; they'll know it if they prepped for the \"Stump the Candidate\" quiz show.; Just look up \"swe fundamentals interview questions\" and you will get a lot of answer and questions of fundamental questions. \n\nThe difference between docker and vm or sql and no sql is really something most people should be curious enough to have looked up when they see them online. I learned the basics of no sql because I kept seeing it online and wanted to know what is different between it and sql. I learned what docker does because I keep seeing it as well. If you don't have that curiosity in this field, then you are going to have a hard time here as technology constantly changes (Docker is only 11 years old)\n\nHow to troubleshoot a slow application, however, is a more a open-ended question where they just wanted to see your thought process, as there really isn't a single correct answer. \n\nI would suggest you study up on SOLID and CLEAN principles...; This thread is blowing my mind, do people really think not understanding things like db normalization and schema is fundamental knowledge. The bar has definitely plummeted. This isn’t trivia, this is literally understanding why and how to build with basic DB tech. You’re going to struggle actually hooking up your business logic correctly if these concepts are foreign…; I'll wait for someone else to chime in with resources, but I want to ask the most important question...after bombing this interview, did you sit down and research every question you didn't know the answer to? Or are you waiting to be spoon fed? \n\nNot trying to be rude here, it's just that while someone may knowledge dump some of this to you, MOST of this career path is coming across something new and unfamiliar and researching on your own to find forward progress.The knowledge base is too broad *and* too deep for you to know everything - you need to teach yourself to be proactive and to learn. \n\nThat said, the docker and SQL questions are fairly rudimentary and you should have known them.; If anybody figures out the difference between a docker and a virtual machine please tell me.  Every explanation I’ve encountered seemed like voodoo.; I'm still pretty junior as an engineer but I'll do my best to help.\n\nYou can watch some fireship videos for quick rundowns on the first two topics that just comes down to general knowledge of common technologies that you pick up over time.\n\nFor making your code run more efficiently the first step is profiling the performance and seeing how fast the code is running and finding the slowest sections of code and work on improving the worst performing sections of code by reducing the cyclomatic complexity of it (big o) which basically means more loops equals more bad. I would look for data structures I could use that might solve the problem in a faster way.\n\nI believe that if you need a scalable solution you can use different algorithms for different scales since some work better with small scales but scale poorly and others work good at large scales but not at small scales. I'm sure there's a more eloquent way of putting that so if anyone else has a better way of explaining it please let me know.\n\nEdit: By cyclomatic complexity I meant looking into Big O notation of the algorithms being used. Cyclomatic Complexity is the measurement of how complex the program is.; Data structures, algorithms, control flow, syntax, reading & understanding documentation, communication, problem understanding; These aren't fundamental CS questions, but fundamental Ops questions (the first two at least)\n\nThe third one is well beyond fundamental.\n\n  \nSounds like the interviewer didn't know what they were talking about; Those are not the fundamentals. Low-level computing (assembler in particular) will teach you the real fundamentals, and C compliments this knowledge when working with sysinternals since you begin to understand memory layout and how the OS works. Once you're comfortable with the low level stuff you can easily troubleshoot most issues and all other topics become extensions of what you've already learned.; I don’t think you did anything wrong by not knowing the difference between SQL and NoSQ because that’s just rote memorization or experience. You don’t need to think too hard to learn how to use a database. Sure, there are advanced concepts for scaling but you shouldn’t be expected to know those unless you’re actually going to be responsible for doing that kind of work.\n\nWhere I think you messed up is not explaining how to figure out why an application is slow. That should have been very easy for you to show that you can think.\n\nHere’s a few questions I would ask the interviewer to clarify and hone in a response.\n\n1. How is this application deployed? Is it for one client or do many clients use it? How many users does a client have?\n\nThat would lead me into my next question.\n\n2. Are other clients complaining about the application being slow? If so, which parts?\n\n3. What is the architecture? Is the application like a monolith or is it like a microservice? \n\n4. Do we know when the application is slow? For instance, is this daily, certain days of the week, or certain hours? Okay none of those, what about a specific season?\n\n5. Does the application ever auto scale to meet demand? Perhaps it’s not scaling enough? \n\nI think there are a never ending number of probing questions you could ask to get down to it and the answer really doesn’t matter. \n\nWhat matters is that you can demonstrate that you can think and that you’re resourceful enough to do research when you hit a roadblock.\n\nI remember a question my current senior dev asked for my first role as a developer. He asked me what I would do if I had a concurrency problem where the application was locking up.\n\nThe first thing out of my mouth was that I’d first see if the process needed to be multithreaded because it may not be a good design choice.\n\nBelieve it or not, I run into so much stuff like that now on the job. Over engineering stuff or just making really weird design choices that might have made sense before but don’t now are common in fields other than just SWE. \n\nYou’re never going to know it all but you can learn frameworks for thinking about problems. Maybe you could pick up more SWE “fundamentals” but I’d suggest instead that you find a book on formal logic and thinking. It can help you better learn to ask questions and understand a problem as you dive deeper into a root cause or just trying to understand the implications of a problem.; I'd maybe like to see the job description where you need to know the difference between docker/vms, sql/nosql, and performance tuning. Touches on a lot of areas like it's maybe Backend SWE/Devops/SRE stuff? Just seems kind of grab baggy. Seems like the interviewer didn't ask great questions.; >trying to memorize a textbook response will hurt you instead\n\nYup. Like another comment said there is so much out there to this software stuff and while some things might be rudimentary, I have to study for the exact thing. I don't have these things off the top of my head. If I just say I want to study as much as I can I know I will forget it two weeks after I've read it. \n\nAlthough I will admit I have a bad habit of being introduced to a tech stack where I just simply use the stack(like docker for example) but never actually set out to understand what it is. \n\nThank you for the suggestions; I don't think I can agree, this line of questioning is much more relevant to our jobs than say, leetcode; If I had to guess, these were all mentioned in the job description and they are screening candidates who did the bare minimum of prep work specific to the job.; I figured. That's why I made this post so if I have an interview again, I will have access to some structured study tools.; 100%\n\n\"What is Docker?\" Isn't a fundamental, it's programming trivia.; I am aware that I don't possess that curiosity at all. I almost never think to go \"oh what's that\". I'm trying to force myself to at least start and then find some sort of schedule to regularly refresh on what I know because they absolutely will not stick.; Ah I had to Google it, I guessed correctly what db normalization was but never heard the term schema. I had never heard them and I can do all kinds of shit. Understand not everyone does what you do in software and it's a huge field."

Build a rapport first.\n\nMy other advice would be to not use your office computer for anything besides work and don't watch Netflix on your phone until you're more familiar with in office behavior and monitoring.; [Always look annoyed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kafq7yrKAOQ); * for the eye strain, get blue light filtering glasses. If you've been blessed with a mac, there's multiple apps that reduce blue light (but aren't as good as the glasses)\n* Don't live in your office, but don't be seen as the guy who's always talking and never working either. It's a balance, but it's important to build relationships while you're in the office. \n* Always be friendly, never be friends (at first - you'll eventually find friends at work, but don't be in a rush)\n* Never talk about guns, god, geopolitics, politics, or reproductive rights. No matter what you say, someone's going to disagree with you. Just smile and nod, and try to softly redirect the question\n* Take the first couple of weeks, and feel everyone out. Be a participant, not a leader in social conversations.\n* Establish your limits early. If you're the doormat who is jsut a yes-man even when you think it's a bad idea or you're being asked to work unreasonable hours, you'll always be the doormat. On the other hand, you don't want to be the bad team player who says no to everything and shirks responsibility. It's a balance, again. \n* You say you have your own office. And you're new. I would try to work as much as possible with the door open and only close it when you have to have a confidential conversation or meeting. Even if nobody ever actually just drops in, people make assumptions about \"door open\" vs \"door closed\" people\n* It's okay to play music since you have your own office. It should be office appropriate (limited cursing, no hard-R's, nothing vulgar or overtly sexual), people should be able to know that there's music playing when they walk past, but they shouldn't be able to hear your lyrics from the next office or nearest cubicle.\n\nGood luck!; If you're noticing eye strain, try blue-light filtering glasses. Also, check your phone to see if there is an \"eye comfort shield\" type of thing that you can turn on and just leave on. Protect your eyes at all cost.; If you pour the last cup of coffee, make another pot.  \n\nOr if your office has k-cups, make sure the pods near the machine are always well-stocked.  There's probably a closet somewhere with more pods that you can move closer to the machine while yours is brewing (when it starts to get low).\n\nMake direct eye contact when speaking to coworkers, but don't stare.  They might think you're trying to challenge for dominance.\n\nFor eye strain, see if you can dim the lighting in your area and use dark mode.  At the very least, position your monitor in a way that reduces glare.  \n\nAsk people whether they're working hard or hardly working.  At least once a day.\n\nGet some good noise cancelling headphones; If you're referring to macOS \"Night Shift\" mode, Windows has something similar called \"Night Light\". Both of them are inspired by f.lux but I don't think there's any real studies proving that these computer programs actually help with eye strain. Because of the LCD backlighting, monitors are still displaying blue subpixels because of how RGB pixels works. Better solution would be the blue light filtering glasses as you mentioned.; I find dark mode strains my eyes more since I find it easier to read dark text on light background. Also most websites are in light mode so switching between dark mode IDE and light mode browser strains my eyes even more.; It's not perfect but there's a browser plugin called [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) that aims to make light mode pages show in dark mode.  But yeah, it's still a pain in the butt when you go to a web site it doesn't work with and your screen lights up.; Yeah I think it's the contrast between the light text and dark background. Light mode flashbangs you but white txt on black sometimes actually sears the text into my eyeballs for a few seconds after I look away. \n\nMy favorite IDE dark mode themes are low contrast with light grey backgrounds and muted colors."

So this means producing blogs, videos, content about data science topics, and sharing them on your LjnkedIn on a daily basis (if possible). This will move you up on the LinkedIn algorithm. You will also learn allot in the process if you are teaching the topics in your content. If you do this and stay consistent, I bet you will get people reaching out to you, and find a job that way. You should still be applying to maybe 20 jobs each day if possible. Then make posts everyday about data science. \n\nOne caveat is that these should be interesting and genuine posts. Don’t just generate something using chat GPT. Your content should be about you solving problems you find interesting. \n\nFor example, I recently did a regression analysis on data I collected from a video game I am very into. I discovered my data suffered from Simpson’s Paradox, which is when the relationships between separate groups are different than the aggregate data. It was interesting because this was unexpected, and I also had to learn a new tool called graph QL to access the API.; Hundreds? That's like 3 weeks of applying.

The interviewing/recruiting process in tech sucks but we don't know a better way.  \n- (Optional/Extra Length) You might need to know at least one backend in which you can comfortably start a project from zero and build a CRUD or a RESTful API without much hassle.  \n- (Optional/Extra Length) Make a cool project that is somewhat atypical, like a videogame prototype.; Thanks that is reassuring.

But in practice, you likely will only need to know a handful of more frequently used ones (like git add, git pull, git checkout, git merge, git push, etc) to make it actually work. IDEs like Intellij IDEA also have built-in Git functionalities, so it's even easier.\n\nI've heard some companies use TDD but I've never worked with one company that actually did.

I still remember the major Git moves but I’d struggle with resetting the head and handling merge conflicts I think. \n\nGood to know about TDD!

   "Title": "Is it worth completing my Computer Science degree?",
   "Top Comments": "well what else would you do? it’s not like software engineering is the only field done on a computer, most jobs nowadays involve very heavy computer use; 1.5-2 years is a crazy timeline for any form of full automation. You said how fast it's evolving and how it only came out in 2023, but do you know how long ai has been played with? It was first thought out mathematically by Turing in 1936 and started to be implemented in  models like SHRDLU and ELIZA in the 1970s. Even the modern Ai has been a thing for a few years before chatgpt. there were chat bots like evie ike 10 years ago. It's not like AI popped out of nowhere in 2023.\n\nAnd that's all assuming AI can even reach that point. In reality, we're still reaching at low hanging fruit. Have you asked ai any quantitative questions? It messes up any form of math rather quickly beyond basic computation.  Higher level order thinking and rational thinking can not be replicated by Ai yet and were not even close. It can't even master language yet. Nuance like sarcasm or actually understanding emotion are beyond its capabilities. \n\nAs for automation, your question is a dead end. If high-level critical thinking jobs have any chance of being taken over, then just about every field is going to be taken over. Even physical jobs like the trades. If ai can become that advanced, it'll be able to start designing robots itself. There is literally nothing you could do. Who knows when it'll be a concern but 1.5-2 years is not even close.\n\n Look at what people in the 80s thought current day would look like.; It’s still worth the knowledge. ChatGPT is NOT taking over jobs. It’s absolutely great at helping me with small tasks, but it’s nowhere near the point of being able to take a goal prompt and completing it fully and correctly. Don’t get discouraged by so many people not even working as devs telling you it’s taking over currently. Personally, I can never see it taking over my role without heavy guidance, meaning it never will, but that’s just me and my experience working with it; If you want to work in tech then I'd argue a CS degree is a no-brainer, unless there are significant financial or external factors that take priority. Given that it seems like you're already in the progress of completing one I'd just finish it IF your goal is to get a tech job.\n\nThat said, there is some value in having a degree at all. So if you don't have a previous degree then you may set yourself back by not having any degree if you ever need to fill out a job application.\n\nIf you are sure you don't want to work in tech (you mentioned starting a business?) then no one can really say. If it's completely unrelated to tech then a CS degree may not even be relevant.; Imo the idea of llms will lead to developers being more productive and thus more thing will be done with software.\n\n\nExecs and PMS aren't gonna build the big complex systems themselves.; If you have to ask, you're in the bottom half of society that will be replaced; ChatGPT helps me be a bit lazier which is great for my mental health lol; Tbh I think every person with imagination that works in software asks the same question. Especially those who want to do something meaningful. And there is no way to answer it. \nBecause AI development is so fast that we have no idea what will come in next months, this also influences companies and we have less jobs, because they don’t want to sink money in projects that will be obsolete after new gpt model release.\n\nAnd there is another question we will face soon, what is the purpose of doing anything when AI can do it better and faster? \n\nAlthough, what we can do now is just to focus on what you like and try to enjoy it, try adapt AI in your work, think out of the box. I’m for example moving from big tech company to smaller one working on green energy and wind power plants because it is meaningful to me, I’ll earn less but I think development in this area is something really important for humanity, nevertheless, I have no idea if what I’ll do won’t be replaced by some AI in next year or two,but until this happens I’ll try to enjoy it.; Supplement your CS education with Math. Build skills beyond software tooling (Eg- web frameworks, language syntax) and put energy into learning core concepts that will more or less always remain true. (Algorithms, Parallel computing, Software Architecture, design patterns); In a quick interview with openAIs CEO, Sam, he mentioned one of the best use cases is programming (could have misheard). However, if it truly gets to a point where it can replace a senior developer then it’s likely capable of doing all critical thinking jobs. Maybe we will get to that point in our lifetimes, but I’m not sure we will. If you like programming keep going! It develops great general problem solving skills.; Rate how this changes is unprecedented. \n\nIn 2018 CS degree was stable and predictable future and no one even guessed its replacement before 2050.   \nIn 2023 GPT was like a 2-month developer, guesses were that until 2030 jobs are safe.  \n4o codes like a 6-month Junior, making 500 line well working apps in seconds, and it's obvious middles will be low paid or replaced to 2030.\n\nRat race started much faster than predicted.; yeah man but there was no such huge sums of money being poured into the field. the amount spent on research has gone up exponentially so we can expect the development of AI to do so as well; Can you magine pouring billions of dollars and supporting development by tech giants starting 1936 every year yet I disagree with OP.; In the early 1800s about 90 in 100 people worked towards the production of food. That number today is closer to about 1 in 100 in post agricultural industrialization USA. Even loosely adjacent and supporting industries only account for about 10 in 100 workers. History has many similar examples.\n\nSure, nothing works perfectly on it's own to start. But software can be R&D'd **much** faster than any physical system.\n\nSoftware is: Almost entirely designed-produced-executed on a computer, text formatted, logic and pattern based. What do large language models excel at? Better yet, which sectors have the highest researched and predicted crossovers with LLMs?\n\n\"They'll still need coders\" You're right, they will, and that number will drop unimpeded over time inversely to improvements made in automation. Till fewer higher level positions are left and capable coders do the work of used to take teams. Demand for coders **will** be outpaced at the current growth rate of AI compute. Companies are already attempting to replace workers with automation.\n\nCoders **will** produce more code in less time. Entry levels **will** be displaced and that **will** continue up the chain. No one knows to what degree or when.\n\nNote: most jobs will be lost in the Capitalist Retribution Ai Automation APocalypse.\n\nHonestly hoping you're right - a junior CS student trying to get a job and beat the clock.; Well said, people keep acting as if it's gonna replace the human race. It's supposed to enhance and improve our lives.; I think you need to factor in how fast it’s growing, it’s exponential and I personally think that we have enough evidence to believe it can complete a task from your boss in a single prompt by about the time I finish my degree. If it doesn’t blow your mind that ChatGPT was initially released in January 2023, and it’s already at this point, I’m not sure what will. It is already starting to take over UI design with v0, the foundation has now been laid. I appreciate the optimism but I honestly rationally think coding doesn’t have a long shelf life from now.; Thank you bro. Super helpful and honest; I agree, however how many jobs will required though? If your workload is more productive by 10x and encompasses the work of a lot of other fields, won’t there only be few employees needed below the execs?; Man you have the best attitude and the most helpful response, I truly appreciate you.; Helpful.

Personally, I did not make it through your post.\n\nGo ahead and edit your comment, adding breaks, and I'll take a look at what you're asking.; If I understand correctly, you go through the traditional interview process, including filling out an application, code test, interview, another interview, they're giving you an offer, you say \"I'll think about it.\" Then they rescind the offer? Is that correct?\n\n  \nAny situation where a company rescinds an offer is not going to be based on a resume - unless they give you an offer before looking at your resume - which I would wonder if it's some sort of scam.\n\n  \nIt probably has something to do with your background or social media presence. Do you have any felonies, arrest records, bad credit, anything that could look bad on a background investigation? If you're not sure consider running your own background check. For social media, do you have any racy content or strongly held beliefs that could be construed as remotely offensive? If you're not sure the answer is probably yes. Go back through any social media and delete anything that's not positive.; Lol my bad, you could probably see the lack of experience just through that message alone. \n\nBut the premise of the message was to basically ask those who have been successful with their internship/new grad searches to showcase their resumes so that those of us still in our first/second years of college could understand what types of skills, projects, and overall candidate positions are being recognized by companies and leading to interviews/success overall.  \n\nThis would allow us to kind of compare the \"standard\" to which companies want to what we as individuals are at with our own resumes. \n\nI hope this was a little more clearer.; Hey thanks for the response!\n\nI have little to no social media presence except LinkedIn. I have no criminal record, not even a ticket.\n\nThe reason I was rescinded was due to “budget constraints” where they eliminated the position.\n\nI was just not getting past the initial application phase and have not gotten a OA or interview in a month now. Maybe 100 applications or so by now.\n\nWhat do you think of my resume as a whole?"

   "Top Comments": "Network. Add people to your linkedin. Learn something new every day. Get good at leetcode. Be interested.; We're all trying to figure that out lol\n\n\nI would suggest you to get through undergrad the easiest way possible, so don't add anything extra in terms of minors if those aren't areas you want to work in. Also apply to an insane amount of internships until you land one. \n\n\nGrad schools are generally easier than undergrad in my experience depending on where you go and what you major in. I highly recommend it, but not in CS. Get your MBA or something along those lines. ; it makes sense to minor in those things if they are genuinely what you are interested in. Whether the job market, in 4 or so years, is still flooded, shouldn't affect what you want to study.\n\n4 yrs is a long time and a whole lot can change. Whatever you want to call this thing happening in the market right now - its gonna normalize, and then sometime down the line it happens again.\n\nI worked at a digital marketing agency fr late 2006-2009. 90% of their revenue was from their main clients, REAL ESTATE.\n\nThis is prob my 3rd phase of unemployment. It's a tough one for sure, and I've been interviewing since Jan 2023. You just work through it, find ways to stay afloat, and at some point the wave passes.; Based on my experience as a new grad:\n\n* You should be aiming to get internships WHILE you're a student. Summers and maybe even part-time if possible.\n* Take key classes ASAP if possible. Data structures, key languages, etc. The sooner you can put them on your resume the better.\n* At the same time, balance your workload such that you have enough time to work on applications/leetcode/projects/etc. \n* I can't speak to minors, but if there's a niche you aim to fill then it could be very good. A friend of mine was a regular CS grad but got recruited by a school-ran bio lab because they needed programming experience but only other bio folks applied. Someone who was in CS but had science experience definitely would have been an easy choice.\n* If you aren't getting interviews, improve your resume. If you are landing interviews but not getting the offer, then work on your interviewing. Mock interviews, public speaking workshops, whatever. It's a skill - don't worry about getting it right the first time.\n* Remember that the market is terrible but the only thing you can control is yourself.; Get good grades, maybe join a club, get a job on the school help desk and most importantly have fun. College is supposed to be fun.; Internships during your degree, not after. Lots of tech, defense, etc offer summer internships. Utilize your schools resources to find them, and look on your own. Some may offer housing stipends, so don't be afraid to look further away from your school. \n\nIf your school has a co-op program, do that.; This is the advice I followed (worked out great), and I gave to my brother (also worked out great). It comes down to 3 steps:  \n\\* Have personal projects you use to demonstrate the ability to learn new things. For example, do you want to learn how networking works? No better way than making a simple SFML C++ chatbox or even a simple game that uses TCP ports to communicate. Another example, do you want to learn how Docker works? Dockerize the same networking application from earlier. You get the point. Each project should allow you to learn something, and be contained for that topic. Also keep all of them as public repositories on GitHub -- I've had more interviewers look at mine than not. Plus if you start now, you will be proud of your GitHub page when you graduate.\n\n\\* Network. This is extremely important. Start early, start now. Make friends with everyone in your program -- you don't know who will help you get an internship or a job. Go to every single event, talk to recruiters, people. Be extroverted even if you aren't. Cold applying to internships and jobs is peeing against a strong wind, hoping you won't get splashed. You always need someone to get your foot in the door.\n\n\\* Finally: practice LeetCode once a week. Learn everything that goes into technical interviews. Because if you put all of that hard work in, you will get some interviews for internships in college. You don't want to whiff because you aren't prepared. Unfortunately, and this is my opinion, technical interviews are very controversial. They don't reflect an engineer's ability to actually work. They reflect how much practice and memorization of LeetCode problems you have done. So work on them.; Find the department faculty that care and visit them in their office hours, they can answer this question more specific to your location and situation.\n\nFind a club that interests you and stick around until they make you president, you'll find the kids who actually enjoy engineering there, and it's great experience and fun. \n\nFind a position in one of the labs at your school as an assistant, you'll learn more there than in most of your classes.\n\nGo to every career fair event even if you're not seriously looking for a job; Look for internships while you are at school and not after. The more you have the better off you most likely will be for when you graduate.; Learn how to have meaningful conversation without shitting your pants.\n\nMost students and professional engineers don't know how to communicate.; Join a CS club and a non CS club. Make friends with your upper classmen, professors, TAs.; Grad school can be a good option for some people. The main factors are (1) can you financially afford it, and (2) can you mentally afford it (meaning, are you genuinely interested enough to spend an additional 2-6 years learning deeply about single subject). If yes, it's probably worth going for most STEM degrees.; [deleted]; Seconded on the co-op program. In the current environment, a good co-op program could be your golden ticket. Companies in the programs tend to be well invested in maintaining the relationship (b/c of things like alumni connections with senior managers/executives). You'll take little longer to graduate, which gives you more time for the software job market to get sorted. You'll be making decent money from it. And you're likely to graduate with a full-time offer from your co-op company."

Often much less stress for marginally less pay.; >  but he tends to break a lot of standards I’ve tried to set in the project. \n\nYour job is to enforce them, not complain on reddit that your junior broke them.\n\nStandards are *entirely* about enforcement, and enforcement is conflict.  If you are conflict adverse, you won't be successful at enforcing standards.\n\n>  clients are getting irritated because we’re pretty behind due to building out modules that turned out to depend heavily on other modules (this was a mix of not having mocks, underdeveloped stories, etc.).\n\nAs a lead you're supposed to be on top of those things.\n\n> I think the fact that I hate leading, \n\nYou hate it because you're not ready to do it.  Some people never are, but don't write it off permanently.  You may grow into it over time.\n\n> this developer is very difficult to work with\n\nMentor them.  Mustangs aren't easy to ride either.  You have to domesticate them.\n\n> I’m tired of working for tech specific companies\n\nI've worked for both tech and non-tech and I like non-tech better personally, too.\n\n>  I don’t enjoy leading projects and I’m unsure if that means maybe I’m not cut out for software development.\n\nThey are different skill sets.  Not everyone has leadership chops. If you're not going to lead, learn how to follow.; I used to be a programming lead, its not for everyone, i enjoyed parts of it but i found the stress / extra responsobility really not worth it for the small jump in salary over a senior role.\n\nYou always will get a developer who wont stick to the coding standards and introduces bad practices into the codebase.  You can intercept these via code reviews but its frustrating telling someone multiple times this is not acceptable and them ignoring it and continuing on as before despite extra training time and attention.  In these scenarios often the only way to resolve the scenario is to swap them out for a better developer (Only really a easy option if a contractor).; I'm in the same place. Lead brings also authority, guidance and more about people than code. What you describe is one of the many problems/issues/tasks you need to address. That's the job. Do you remember that time where you needed to find a way to open/write/produce a file programmatically and check the exceptions etc? Thats the same, just an issue, you need to address, based on you leadership skills. \n\nI'm also a project lead, and one member is underperform. Its like he's working second job. Whenever I contact him to ask him how is it going (he never contact us, no matter how much time we give him) he says \"hey just finished the task\", which is obviously a lie. So, yes, thats my job, I get paid to address this in a way and NOT write a new class to get the file from aws s3. \n\nDo I enjoy it more? It depends from the project and the people. Some times project/codebase etc are shit, sometimes those are good but members/devs are bad. I would prefer being a hamble developer and get tasks on jira done and get paid, because I feel that this offers more job security and less stress. But here I am, was promoted to the role from dev and didnt say no.; Mostly venting\n\nSeems like you don’t like being uncomfortable. Which is pretty common. Take the lead. Learn from it. Build your career and salary.; It's neither bad nor good, but it is career limiting to never lead projects. Leading projects is difficult. The challenge is not only the leadership function, but because most projects are not clearly defined, and stakeholders are unable to describe their actual problems and bottlenecks they are trying to solve.\n\nIn any moderately complex organization there's a good chance your project won't do the thing the company  wants and is a waste of time, but a lot of people are getting paid behind that waste, so it's difficult to put a stop to it.\n\nThere's another type of bad project where it is utterly necessary but drastically underfunded. These are challenging to lead for different reasons.\n\nConsider that you don't hate project leadership as such, but hate bad projects.; I've seen a lot of people do individual contributor work, get promoted to be a manager, and then dislike being a manager.\n\n  \nFor the OP, you listed a lot of things you don't like. What are work tasks and environments you would like? Start from there and find a job that is the closest fit.; It's a waste of energy but the world is nuts behind waste ( for how long ;)? ). Also try creating linter rules for the standards; As you get older, it will become increasingly more difficult to avoid, especially if your inherent leadership skills grow. I’m the same way. I’m 42 and despise leading teams. However, every team I’m on for the past 8 years they just keep piling leadership responsibilities on me. I’ve read this is likely because I exhibit competence in these skills. So just remember, kids, never be good at something you don’t want to do. 🤣; this is what I wonder, being a mid role at a FAANG seems like a better option to me that senior leadish at a normal company.; Just  quick update if anyone sees, I really appreciate everyone’s feedback here. I thoroughly do not enjoy leading, however I’m going to take this experience and try to grow from it.\n\nI have a lot to learn as a developer, only roughly two years of experience professionally, I’m not exactly looking for some massive pay increase either as I’m very happy and comfortable with my current salary. But I do want to grow as a developer and a team player.\n\nAgain, thanks everyone so much! I guess I need to learn to extend my love for software development a little more outwards towards the more social aspects of the job 😅; [removed]; For all the doom and gloom on this sub about AI and Offshoring replacing jobs. Bring a Team lead / tech lead is the least likely to be replaced. \n\n\nAnyone can be a code monkey but it's harder and more desired by companies to have someone who can read between the lines of the business ask and make sure it actually happens. ; Nothing wrong with that. Not everyone is cut out for leadership. Some people would rather just be responsible for themselves rather than a group of people.; There is nothing wrong with it. I know several who don’t want to lead and they have over 20 years of experience and still don’t lead. Great developers but they don’t want to lead nor would they be good at it. \n\nThey make a good living and the biggest price you end up paying is it does become career limiting. Limiting as you will not really move beyond a Senior Software Engineer. Also it’s fine as Senior dev is considered a terminal position and no one is expected to move beyond that.; This is fine. Not everyone likes this role; it is quite stressful and can be off-putting. Attracts either those who love good salaries, or those who are passionate about this business. Don't worry if you don't like it. Change it and do something about it.; If you recognize that you might not be great and you care about that, then maybe you should be a lead, even if you don't want to. :D\n\nWhat's hard about the new guy who doesn't follow rules? Just keep rejecting his PRs and explaining stuff.; I would encourage you to work on your skills of mentoring and leading if you want to advance in the field. Especially in a monetary sense. Every organization I've been apart of wants their experienced engineers to lead in some capacity. It is a normal, and I would even go as far to say it should be expected, for all engineers to reach an \"architect\" level on projects where you are more and more removed from the actually every day coding and problem solving to one of setting the example for other engineers to follow. It doesn't mean you'll get away from coding altogether, but you'll likely do it less and less over time. It also doesn't mean you have to be a manager, but at some point in your career you will have to lead. It's only if you are REALLY bad at your job that management will avoid putting you in that position and it would also be very likely to be managed out (PIP) at that point anyway.\n\nWith that said, it's probably that you're having to do this sooner than you should be. Probably due to limited resources and less hiring to fill roles right now. I would encourage you to stick with it and get this experience under your belt. Yeah, it sucks you have a little less control over how things are done. Yeah, it sucks that your client is irritated. But this is also normal.\n\nUnless your leadership is also being a dick about it or is completely unsupportive, I would stick around. I completely sympathize. In my first job, I didn't want to lead others. Hell, I didn't even want to talk to anyone if I could help it, but that expectation is more of the exception and not the rule these days IMO.; What if the dev introducing bad practices is the lead himself? He's just so bad , no regards for code quality. Claims to have 25 yoe and I can't stand the work he produces and when I suggest improvements he just refutes everything. So frustrating working with this guy. But since he continuously claims he has so many yoe, the PM assigned him as a lead but I don't feel I can learn anything from this guy. Can't stand it.; I don't know why people want to be leaders in anything. When I was given my first project to lead I clearly remember previously unknown \"The Responsibility\" concept hitting me like a truck."

If a client needs an app or web pages, the consultant should build what they need with proven tools, not a tool to build what they need.; Sounds like a normal consulting company to me.\n\nThe one consulting place I worked end up more or less with their version of word press for clients that just slowly evolved out of optimizing our own work flows after hundreds of sites. By the time I left in 2015 they were trying to just migrate clients to word press though, and build on top of it.\n\nThen on the flip side of that the owners would never say no to any work. So if someone asked for a \"ML algorithm to predict asteroid trajectories\" you could bet we were going to do it regardless of if we had the credentials.; Right, I'm talking about a consulting firm that offers personalized/custom software development services as well as an app-suite if the task doesn't involve super high-level expertise or if the client isn't really a tech company. For instance, if a plumber wanted to create an app for his business so it'd be easier to schedule jobs and wants it done quick and easy he could use the no-code platform for the app development. \n\nBut if the client is a high-level tech startup trying to develop a novel ML algorithm to predict asteroid trajectories from spatial data, then that'd require more customized services, and they could offer that. \n\nThat's the type of arrangement I was curious about whether it exists or not.; u/EngStudTA  perfect. This is exactly the kind of example I was looking for. A follow-up question:\n\nWould a company that did something like developing internal tools to help simpler client cases (maybe not word press but something else like a no-code platform) be eligible for VC funding? Or are consulting firms of any sort not eligible for it? The reason I ask is that on Khosla Ventures' website it talks about how they don't fund SMBs and are more interested in investing in novel tech companies. Would a consulting firm that does internal product development as well as client/contract services qualify?; Only if they find a way to say AI /s\n\nBut that's not my area of expertise.

   "Title": "TikTok vs Startup job offer",
   "Top Comments": "How stable do you think the startup might be? If location doesn't matter, one of the biggest concerns I would have is stability. With the whole TikTok ban going on and ByteDance does not seem to want to sell it off. It could potentially be dissolved in a few months or it could go through years of legal battles with nothing happening to it in the end.; Both bets are risky, and for different reasons. Obviously Tiktok has the ban looming overhead, but the startup is risky as well because of interest rates being so high, you have to wonder if they can stay afloat until money gets cheaper to borrow. Cost of living would be similar, but USD is stronger than CAD so you'll probably have more disposable income in NYC. Honestly I would negotiate the startup to 140ish and call it a day.; You should first learn about exchange rates and how to compare amounts in different currencies.  Then geography.; That $40m is how much runway? If 3-5y, then they'll probably make it to better investment climates. If <1y, that'd be a no from me.; go to USA; It really depends on whether you want to live in New York or Vancouver. Personally I’d go Tik Tok. Good name to get on your resume and more stable.; def startup.\n\nwould rather cut my nuts off than work at tiktok tbh; Yeah the TikTok ban is my worry. If it can last for the 9 months at least I’d take it, I’m just worried about the possibility it would dissolve earlier.\n\nStartup seems fairly stable. They’re profitable which is nice. I just don’t 100% know what the market size for it would be. It already is valued way higher than I think it would be…; Tiktok isn't going to be banned anytime soon. It's one of the most unconstitutional BS that's ever been proposed. There's no way in hell that shit is going to pass.; Yeah I feel like i should have negotiated. past the phase now… the TikTok salary was negotiated higher, but never negotiated with the startup cause I thought it was already fair; I’ve lived and worked in both countries so I already know. When u expense in cost of living and taxes in each region, they turn out to be the same.\n\nI’m less concerned about the money and more about which would be better for my career as a new grad. My choice rn is the startup, but a voice in the back of my head keeps saying having TikTok on my resume will look much better than a startup.; When should startups raise new cash? My assumption was 6 months of runway or less.\n\nKeep in mind that 40m is the valuation not the cash; It’s not even 40 mill he said 40 mill valuation, meaning it’s probably like 10 mill; So previously raised 3M at a 15M valuation 2 years ago, the team is small (like 7-8 people). I would think they still have cash from the previous raise, So I’d assume the runway is decent, atleast a year… but not 100% sure what all their costs are. I was told they’re profitable though; I wanted Bay Area… Vancouver is more my typa city (outdoors in nature) but NYC would force me outside my comfort zone and is closer to home (Toronto); I'm curious about why?  Is it because you don't like the product or is there something terrible about the working conditions at Tik Tok?; Sure it may take a year or two, but why join a company with a a guillotine looming over it? Just take the startup; It's just a job.  Pick the one that best fit current circumstances, then get better job next, rinse repeat.; I recommend asking them.; I’d go with Tik Tok.

   "Title": "What kind of an annual raise should you expect for \"exceeds expectations\" on performance review?",
   "Top Comments": "This varies so widely by company I'm not sure there is any generic advice here that would begin to apply. \n\nYou could have gotten 3% last year, have a better review this year and still get only 3% (or less) because the company is stricter this year. You could have gotten 3% last year and get 6% this year because you did better and the company made more money available. So many factors that you aren't privy to. \n\nIf you aren't happy with your total comp, then talk to your manager about it. But have information about market rate and what others are making and how you think the percentage compares to last year when you have a better review this year.; Depends on the industry. I work in banking, was rated an exceeds in all metrics and got a 3% raise.; Depends on the company and economic conditions.; The salary raises companies give are shitty compared to what you can get landing an offer elsewhere. But yeah, a 3-5% salary raise is usually what they'd call a promotion or whatever BS they call it lol.; I would not expect more than 3% .; So many companies award their managers a “raise budget” each year to be spread across their staff based on performance and pay equity. Ideally, everyone who has the same role and is performing at the same level, like “exceeds”, makes the same amount of money. That is harder than it sounds. Say you improve from “meets” to “exceeds” this year. That should earn you a solid increase as you are now compared to the other exceeds and your distance from average salary in this group is significant. The following year you remain at exceeds. Since last year you got a nice bump to move your salary closer to the average, your increase this year will be less significant. The bigger bumps will go to new arrivals in exceeds. The impact of falling back to “meets” is brutal.\n\nIs this an ideal system? Of course not! But it is the reality for many of us.; At Microsoft, last year it was 0%. This year it looks like it will be around 2% which doesn't even cover inflation. \n\nThey know that with the current market people are unlikely to leave. And if they leave, they probably can get someone for cheaper or simply do not backfill it and put the load on existing workers.; There is a org wide budget allocated.\n\nOne has to take from Steve to give it to Peter or the other way around.

Inconsistent - 1% to 2%\n\n1. Does not meet expectations - 0%\n\nThe above guidance changes based on the company size, department impact on revenue and overall growth, and relevance to the business among many other factors.\n\nRemember, the budget is fixed; the allocation can be adjusted based on individual performance.; $1,000,000 USD. ; I work in banking, got EE and a 6% boost.; I exceeded expectations, got a 4 out of 5 rating which required SVP approval, and received 3.5%.\n\nPeople rated Needs Improvement still got 2%..; I got 4% for exceeding expectations + some stock ($15k) + bonus ($9k). \n\nDon’t expect much unless it’s a smaller company.; Don't listen to the \"budget is tight\" nonsense, every company will say this come review time. All it means is that they're hoping you don't try and argue about getting a larger raise.; I got 6% for a “meets” though im not sure why, my manager even said it was above avg so im guessing cuz i was being paid less than i should or something, but based off that id assume 6% would be the ballpark for “exceeds”; Speaking as a manager: I do not get allocated extra money for high performers. I get allocated money as if everyone is a 'meets expectations' and should get the same amount. If I want to give someone more I have to give someone else less, or I have to go to my boss and ask them to take budget from another team and give it to me. Sometimes the budget is only enough to do 3% for everyone and I have to say 'budget is tight', sometimes it's enough to give everyone 4.8% and people are pretty happy.; I got 5% for that, then this year got 3% for meeting expectations when I did more work.  Guess they changed expectations when I exceeded them…; I got exceptional last year and this year. Last year I got 10%. I find out this week what I’m getting for this year.; Unless you are underpaid or a key resource, probably 1-3%, be glad you were not laid off. Most businesses are into \"high performance\" and getting rid of \"low performance\" employees.; In my experience, 0-3%, unless you change employers.; Almost universally it's 3% regardless of performance. You don't get more money for better performance, you just don't get your 3% if you suck."

You should’ve seen 2020-2022 it was insane 😂\n\nI wouldn’t say it’s an American thing. Just a Gen Z / lower millennial thing in 1st world countries.

You have any good resources? Or just ol reliable YouTube; You’re just feeling rusty? Code up some silly project on your own.\n\nOr don’t.

Also, they might ask why you chose software engineering as a profession, and what makes you interested in it.\n\nAt the end of the day, just go into the interview with a friendly, kind attitude. That goes a really long way.; Likely a behavioral interview. Prepare STAR responses for the top 20 or so behavioral questions you might get, and be prepared to adapt your answers if the questions are delivered in different ways. Reflect upon your projects and what impact you had.\n\n\nDon't want to scare you, but there's likely still plenty of competition at this stage. The manager is going to try to determine if they think you're a good fit, and there's lots of bias that will come into play that you don't have control over. What you can control is your level of preparation and the enthusiasm you bring to the table.; I wouldn't consider it a guaranteed offer. I made that miscalculation with a company a few weeks ago. Passed the full-round interview - and the team matching round was pitched as a \"casual conversation\" rather than an interview - but ultimately there was no team match and I didn't get the gig. No matter how the interview is pitched to you, treat it like another interview. Like others said, prep your STAR examples, be positive, etc. Nothing's over until you sign something.; Nothing is set in stone yet; it does not mean that you have passed. Manager interviews tend to be behavioral in nature with some technical background, but no coding or system design. They are looking for someone who can make their job easier.

But I think it depends more on what industry you want to work in. Like for example if the defense industry is your goal, then Boeing or Lockheed would probably mean a lot more to another defense company than a position at Google.; This doesn’t exist.\n\nThere are maybe 30(?) or so companies you can have in your work history that will usually make a recruiter want to talk to you for any job where you’re roughly qualified, and they’re basically the ones you’d expect. Beyond that, there’s a standard hiring process that everyone has to follow.; There is no company whose alumni I would automatically hire without interviewing them first. Even if someone worked for a prestigious company, they may not be the best fit for the role you're hiring for. Their technical skills and experience may not be as relevant, or they may not be a good personal fit. On the other hand, someone from a no-name company might be exactly who you're looking for in a candidate. Companies that hire *solely* based on the prestige of an applicant's resume/CV are doing hiring wrong.; Don't think there's any workplace that would hire you just because you had another company on your resume. If there were, you probably don't want to work there. \n\nBut if we think about it as \"Oh shit, this guy worked at XXX. Let's interview him\", I think that'd be a lot more realistic. Any big tech company would probably do that for you.; Probably a lockpick manufacturer; I worked as a contractor for Microsoft.  This definitely got me a job that I worked for 5 years.; This feels like the wrong question to me. If company is impressed by your resume purely based on brand name, then they’re likely a lower tier company. \n\nWithin the same tier however, there is no preferential treatment as far as I can tell. \n\nIe, if you work for Apple and go to target tech your Apple brand name may matter. Among the other FAANG companies it does not afaik.\n\nAssuming you want to grow, you ought to be targeting better and better companies as you progress in your career. At that point, it’s kinda moot what halo your previous companies give you.; I found it easier to get interviews after having FAANG on my resume, but didn't find it any easier to actually get an offer.  I think it's in those \"gets your foot in the door, but landing the job is up to you\" things. YMMV.; Off the top of my head, OpenAI, Databricks, Stripe, Netflix, Meta, Nvidia, certain hedge funds; Especially if it's someone from the late 2020-2022 era. I've seen a few resumes get into FAANG and laid off shortly after but their project scope and contributions seemed to be quite small during their 2-3 year tenure.\n\nAlthough the current layoffs/slowdown are largely unrelated imo, FAANG definitely overhired just to have headcount maintaining or sitting around on payroll. Having a large breadth of YOE does mitigate against that risk somewhat."

It's not gouging or predatory to offer less than other people are offering. Again either they'll get terrible candidates compared to if they offered \"enough\" for you, or maybe you're not as special as you think you are.

The prescription tracking in particular doesn't work at all. Now I know why.; Thats what I thought. It's far less than they used to pay.\n\n\nPeople that don't see reductions like this as problematic need to wake up.; Name and shame is just based on shitty behavior from a company. \nAdding a small edit to the post now.; Because pointing out to others that this particular company is participating in the 'race to the bottom' trend is bringing awarness to the situation.\n\n\nIt's letting other devs know that this company is one that they might want to avoid.\n\n\nSome companies are contributing to this and many are not. Noticing where different companies are landing here is a net positive for all of us.\n\n\nName and shame by definition does not imply deciept, although it appears to be a common misconception.; Because they are suddenly greatly reducing the base salary that they offer."

I see people on this sub claim that you would get passed over for a local... but I don't really believe that. I think people would just rather blame something out of their control like location rather than their poor resume, or bad luck. Companies want to hire the right person. Where they happen to be located isn't really a metric a company cares about. If you're willing to relocate, and they like your resume, you're going to get an interview.

Apply and get a new one, then leave. Or just leave. The advice remains the same: it’s easier to get a new job when you have one. You were unemployed long enough to know the job search is hard. 3 months experience is not going to change that.\n\nMake a decision. Reddit isn’t going to help change the reality of your situation.; Depends on if you're leaving for another job or not.; That depends on you.\n\nSome people can do that and have something else lined up in a couple months, so they wouldn't be screwed at all.\n\nBut the fact you had a 14 month gap before getting your current job isn't a good sign. So you specifically would probably be royally screwed.\n\nWhat the overwhelming majority of people do when they're at a job they don't like is they line up another one before quitting. You can hope for the best, but you need to prepare for the worst. The worst case scenario is it takes you another 14+ months to find a job.\n\nIf you're employed during that time, even if you're unhappy, you'll at least be collecting a paycheck and can feed yourself and not be homeless. If you quit without something lined up, that's a *massive* financial risk, and can only hurt your career more.\n\nThere's also another element to this. When people are unemployed they tend to get desperate. When you're desperate, you start ignoring red flags during the interview process and end up accepting whatever you can get. This usually results in people ending up in another toxic company where they're just as if not more miserable. Then they want to leave that company, get desperate, and join another toxic company out of desperation to leave their current toxic company.\n\nIt's a vicious cycle.

All while they are complaining that everything is important and needs to get done asap yet we have time to keep all the devs in hour long meetings.\n\nThey have zero respect for peoples time. For every little inconvenience they call people on pto. Idc what it is they will call you. Oh we need a label update? Manager is on the phone with someone on pto instead of just telling us about the update so one of us in the office can update the freaking label. We don't know someone was called on pto until after the work is done. I have made it a point to put my phone on do not disturb when on pto or even weekends because they call for every tiny little thing and I have just started ignoring them. \n\nWe are paid below market price but have the responsibility of people making 6 figures. They constantly micromanage time entries, do group punishment because they are too afraid to call the seniors out for anything they do, so they punish EVERYONE for what the seniors do. And it's no secret either. The seniors are cocky about it because when a punishment was being laid out for example one of the seniors who was the main offender literally said \"i already do that by choice so it wont affect me\". (Limiting how much I say so it's not obvious because the seniors also sit on reditt all day at work lol). Others have said similar stuff like \"he's talking about me\" when the manager is complaining about something but wont call the senior out directly. So the seniors know they are getting us in trouble they just dont care.\n\nBeen trying to find a new job but you all know how the market is.; I'm just an intern, so maybe take my advice with a grain of salt. In my opinion, having toxic atmosphere on the work is pretty bad, I would recommend you start looking for a new job but not living current one unless you sign the new contract. \n\nWork is the place where we spend a lot of time, and  having such a big part of your life being stressful will not have good effects on your mental health in long term; I used to HATE my actual day to day work. My coworkers, salary and work environment were very chill, but the actual work itself was insufferable. I really disliked learning about the intricacies of the business logic. The users were never on my mind because I just didn’t care. I have since transitioned to a different branch of software development altogether and I can say that I genuinely love my job. Working on a product you care about for users you care about changed everything for me. And not working on crud apps.; 10% hate, 10% less than ideal, 50% love, 30% neutral.; Nothing is WORST than unemployment; It comes and goes in waves depending on the day, honestly. I'm currently sick of my job at the moment, due to some mismanagement, lost interest in the project, and at the moment being stuck dealing with technical debt because some library hasn't been updated to the latest version in nearly a decade.\n\nI actually really like my colleagues overall and have made some fun friends, but yeah, pretty over the work and lack of fulfillment.; I’ll take it, buddy. Let me know your boss’s email.; As soon as I realized that I'm being paid to do what the company / management / my boss sets as priority I became much more tolerant about my job.  That doesn't mean I'm a yes man as I push back on things all the time.  I give people options and then commit to the decisions.\n\nI don't see my job as a SWE as somebody who sits in front of a computer fingers to keyboard coding all day. I solve business problems with code and as such dealing with emails, other people, and process is part of the job being a SWE. I don't fight it. I just go along with it and have been much happier over the years.\n\nIf you want me to sit in meetings all day this week I can do that, but don't expect me to get feature X to meet the definition of done by Friday.  If you deem me sitting in meetings is worth what you are paying me then so be it.\n\nWhen management does not want to heed my advice on estimates and schedules I don't kill myself to meet what they want. I work my normal pace and what gets done gets done.  Management learns when things fail not when you cover their ass by working 70 hours per week.  If anything I have found killing yourself to get things done just reinforces to management that they were correct on the schedule the whole time.\n\nYou cannot change other people at the end of the day.  So I make sure to change myself and adapt to the situation instead of trying to fight them the whole way.  Of course there are limits to this, but I'm talking about normal work situations.  I'm not talking about situations where manager asking a SWE to help them steal money in the banking software or harm people somehow.; [deleted]; I hated every single second of my SDE job.; I see it in this perspective: there’s not a single thing that is bearable to do for 8-10 hrs a day 5 days a week. If you tell me to do any of my leisure activities for that long too I would hate doing them as well (ex: watching TV, playing video games, traveling, playing a sport, etc for 40 hrs a week). So I don’t hate my job because the job sucks necessarily but I hate it because of how much of my time it sucks up; Most of the people I work with as soft engineer, hate their jobs but love coding. These are two diff things. Job has tough deadlines, things need to work, regardless of meetings, 3rd party issues, team miscommunications etc. For every bulk of our your extra hours you worked for a task, they all go to trash as soon as your scrum master marks the task completed.; I love my job. The tech stack... I tolerate 😁; I've been in shitty jobs.  I like this one coz I genuinely have good people that I work with, specially when it comes to personal time and space. The company isn't the best when it comes to salaries but I'm comfortable and have great WLB. I don't really have loyalty to the company though,  as much as I have loyalty to my peace of mind which I get plenty of over here; I've never hated my job, whichever one I was in. I'm not saying I'd do it for free, but I don't dread Mondays,  and I like my colleagues. The work is interesting and there is little management bullshit.\n\nYou can probably do better."

You'll be able to put in more effort, and have a greater knack for appreciating the nuance of the domain.\n\nIf you're going purely for marketability / salary, find the things that are (1) useful for generating revenue (\"make yourself useful\") and/or (2) require uncommon/difficult/unpleasant skill sets.\n\nI went in on graphics programming because I find it fascinating, there's far fewer graphics programmer jobs than web dev jobs but also far _far_ fewer skilled developers in that field (caveat: I don't actually work primarily as a graphics programmer).\n\nFinance is probably a better one, that industry hires a lot of low level super performance C++ devs. It's a hard skill set to build and one that has the potential to make rich people more rich, so not a hard sell to get a fat paycheck to do it. But you have to be real good at it to succeed there, and sell your soul (or at least your work/life balance) just a wee bit.; I agree with your professors.  In a tough job market for entry level SWEs, it’s hard to be the best match for a job and beat out other candidates if your resume says, “I have no special skills, except being good at SWE in general”.; Look at job openings where you would like to live and see what is in demand for entry level; Location isn’t a huge factor unless you live in a different country; Do they hire remote for entry level? I'm across the country in bfe.; Remote for entry level is going to be a lot harder to get. For entry level, I would recommend being open to relocation; I'm not opposed to relocating.

   "Title": "Do we all realize that AI is a lose lose for SWE and CS Majors?",
   "Top Comments": "Do we all realize that we don't need an AI doomer post every single day on this sub?; \"Experienced\"; If AI really is powerful enough to take over the CS industry in a meaningful way, it would decimate so many other white collar industries before it got to that stage. We're not seeing that yet, so I don't think the downfall is any time soon. Realistically though I think it would just improve productivity rather than replace developers.\n\nAt most tech jobs, the bottleneck is bureaucracy, not dev time. So an AI that can code faster doesn't really improve anything, unless we can replace clients and project managers with AI so we don't have to wait a week for them to unblock a ticket just for some mundane reason like phrasing or translations. \n\nAs for the next tech boom, I think that will just happen the next time we have low interest rates again tbh. Regardless if AI is a fad or not thats the next time companies will be compelled to throw money around.; You have no new insight on this matter. The only concern is that somehow you didn’t use the AI to summarize posts about the AI. What the fuck, be consistent at least.; SWE was a boom to begin with. It’s normalizing now, so our pay is going to slowly tick down until we’re like the engineers of the 20th century’s automobile industry. This is natural, and who knows what the next boom industry will actually be. I’m sure SWEs will be a part of that boom too, but maybe not as highly valued as we’ve been the last 20 years. \n\nWe should start considering unions, because our time as labor aristocracy in this country is coming to an end.; Maybe if less people like you joined the industry, people who actually enjoy CS and aren't just in for the money could have higher chances of entering a less saturated job market.; I think...we are going to have more trouble getting jobs.\n\nBut not because of AI.\n\nBut rather because companies don't want to share the monies.  I heard that companies were making a lot of money recently.\n\nI personally can't think of a way to monetize nor use AI, it writes essays right?\n\nBelieve it or not, it is incredibly likely that the reasons why we struggle is because of something other than one specific reason that is marketed (and only recently too).\n\nIf it wasn't this scapegoat, companies would find another scapegoat to blame on \"where all our wages went\".; You conclusions don't follow from your axioms. Did you see Apple shipping new chips to do LLMs on iPhones or Adobe putting out ads about Photoshop generative fill? It's only a matter of time until we have Siri-powered generative fill built directly into the iPhone camera app. That's tangible progress in the AI space that doesn't support any of the silly \"stealing jobs\" arguments.\n\nAnd for the record, \"AI\" is a buzzword whose definition shifts goalposts every year. As a field, it has been chugging along for years before ChatGPT ever came along, we professionals just call it ML. It has brought you Google search, Netflix recommendation algorithms, Uber driver-passenger pairing, Duolingo, Grammarly and a bazillion other things you probably take for granted, and will continue to encroach on every day life while you're distracted with the FUD du jour.; It's a false thinking.\n\n>Let's employ some logic , the same logic most here learned in undergrad. If AI is a fad/bubble , then there is no new CS SWE job boom in the horizon, as it will slowly start to deminish , and not become the talk of the town at every company.\n\nThere is no need for a boom. Sure, some booms are nice, but let's be real, most jobs still revolve around Web & Mobile development. With the current IoT with AI combination in uprising.\n\nAI is still having an impact. There are lots of product being made leveraging AI.; For all Gertner’s flaws, the hype cycle theory holds pretty well. \n\nA. It is what it is hyped to be, we will reach the singularity, if we haven’t already and aren’t aware. This is an acceleration effect, so it will advance in exponentially shorter time.\n\nB. Its marketing hype capitalizing on fantasy and hubris. We will enter a trough of disillusionment from which the wheat will separate from the chaff and those new jobs will emerge.\n\nAdditional notes: Thus LLM craze is likely unsustainable form a pure resource allocation perspective. Much like crypto mining. Humans are using it to do things our brains are infinitely more energy efficient at doing, but also for doing things that a more parsimonious tool is capable of demoing equally fast while using less electricity. People are trying to get it to behave deterministically, which is just pure irony. And all that because what the business types riding this bandwagon want is - an infallible human like entity that can do all the things a human can do, including interacting with humans (and other robots pretending to be humans), that is perpetual and requires none of the things humans require, while being infinitely scalable, all in a package they as humans can observe and relate to, and likely anthropomorphize. ; The 'AI' fad if not a fad will kill all work in the long term, so this issue wouldn't be isolated to SWE and CS; It’s simple really. The AI scare is just the incorrect diagnosis of current and growing symptoms of late-stage Capitalism.; if the AI bubble did pop, most companies would be blaming the general public when they overspend it over billions of dollars. My biggest concern is that the Tech pipeline is going to dry out when more companies make the tech jobs much harder to get.; The sole purpose of tech is to automate, and make our lives easier - coincidentally, they will be automating themselves (and others) out of a job. But that is not the case now. In the future, maybe so. \n\nAI isn’t a fad and it is here to stay. After talking to others across various fields, the models that exist now are not powerful enough to really replace anyone yet. Companies are just outsourcing people and using AI as an excuse. \n\nAI growth is exponential, however, and CEOs will continue to throw millions of dollars into investing in AI tech. It’s hard to give a timeframe of when the disruption will begin. Maybe it’ll happen across all fields all at once, or maybe some fields will be hit sooner. Accounting will likely be the first to be disrupted which is why I’m trying to leave. \n\nThe disruption won’t happen this year but I’m willing to bet that things will look different in 2030. Not Star Trek different, but white collar work will look different. Less manual tasks, more talking to people so it’s going to suck for us introverts. \n\nAll in all, it’s nothing to worry about now but it is something to be on the lookout for and be prepared to always be learning. The idea of a stable career is pretty much over. This is coming from someone who is trying to pivot away from accounting and into tech. Yes, I understand that some elements of Accounting work cannot simply be automated due to laws and regulations but entry level work will be dried up. B4 has in-house SWEs automating many things for the accountants. Not that accountants are being replaced, rather, there will be accountants needed and that entry level will cease to exist as time goes on. \n\n\nAll in all, best not to worry not but always be on the lookout and always be willing to learn and upskill. And also just accept what is happening. AI isn’t a fad but it isn’t a game changer right now.; If literally all you do is write sub-standard code you're possibly in trouble maybe eventually.  If you do *anything* that involves coordinating or being part of a team, liaising with others, working out how to solve a problem that doesn't have an immediate click a button solution, you're probably more likely to be using it as a productivity tool than be replaced by it.\n\nCompanies massively over-hired during Covid, now they're shedding that extra weight and more that they've acquired over the years.  \"AI\" is mostly just the excuse they're using.   I'd argue that many of the information age jobs that could be replaced by AI applications have already been outsourced to places like India.  If the job was simple enough to be done by an AI, there's no way the company was paying US/Canada wages for someone to do it.; People will respond by arguing AI hasn't cost any software engineer jobs yet, but it has. I'm personally aware of at least 100 jobs cut primarily and specifically because of AI.; i heard welding is the next big thing; People will need to adapt and gain domain knowledge; I get that it isn't great out there, but I am 100% sure that people's chances would improve at least a small amount if they spent less time feeling sorry for themselves om Reddit; If AI could take a software engineers job it would take a CRAP ton of jobs before it got to us then. Software engineer literally design automated ways to do other peoples jobs. If AI could do what we do then most desk and clerk jobs in the world would be in trouble. So there's really no reason to worry about it unless you're going to change careers to something AI wont hit for a while. And even then it'll only be a matter of time before AI takes those jobs. \n\nYou can live in a state of paranoia or just live your life at this point.\n\nAnd lets be honest, AI wont take over in our life time. That'll be an issue for our kids kids well after we are retired or dead."

If you cannot even get 1 job offer, then the current rate is your only option. But if you get a couple offers for 15, 20, and 25% more pay, you know somebody else is willing to pay you more.\n\nThe beauty of having other jobs offers is that if you ask for a 20% increase at your company and they respond with a hard no, you already have an offer in hand that you can accept at another company that gives you the raise that you deserve.; I’ve see a 6 month raise given to new employees if they’ve done well.  There’s a lot of companies that don’t do 6 month raises normally after the first year or at all.  I wouldn’t expect you to get any more of those.  When you did get this raise and bonus?  March? April?  This could be a year end performance raise and bonus based on length of employment.   Normally a performance review is involved.  I’d ask if that a one time 6 month raise or year end raise.\n\nNormally raises are given out after the end of the year.   The company has to evaluate its financial performance and set budgets for the upcoming year.  The budget is usually used to allocate raises.  \n\nI can’t remember the last time I heard of a person asking for a raise and getting one.  Budgets aren’t  set with potential raises in mind.  If you have an offer from outside the company, the company may decide to match but I don’t see this often.; Curious to know did you not get an opportunity to negotiate your raise during and/or after your performance rating meeting.

   "Top Comments": "Salary starts hitting the limit at low 200s if you limit yourself to high-impact individual contributor engineering work in the US proper.\n\nIf you also do some sales/growth work (ex. Helping win contracts) you can pass that. \n\nPay can also go up if you’re willing to accept overseas travel, especially in terms of TC.  It’s *real* easy to get stupidly high TC on long-term travel assignments where your living expenses are fully covered.; A lot of layoffs and contract cancellations going on right now in traditional defense due to government budgeting, so compensation growth is pretty flat; Since no one else will provide actual numbers - I'm currently at 12 YOE at a large traditional defense contractor and getting $180k base, TC of just over $200k.; I’m at 3 YOE 135k on the east coast; 4 YoE and sitting at $140k base. I’ve seen contracts that pay $190-200k at the 5 year mark.\n\nLabor categories tend to be real stingy depending on the customer.; When I worked at Lockheed, the level 3 (8-ish years, entry PhD) pay for AI/ML engineers was around 140k from what I saw, and that role is one of the highest pay bands. This was in a medium cost of living area.\n\nI was a level 1 at Lockheed and jumped ship to a smaller / specialized defense contractor and make about 150k as a lvl 3 AI/ML Engineer now. I know the pay range goes up to 230k for the role. \n\nThe larger contractors (Raytheon, Northtrop, Lockheed) all seem to fall behind in pay relative to the smaller more specialized ones.; I’ve left the field but I’ll offer this as a a general advice: pay scales poorly in defense with HCOL areas but gets really good as COL gets cheaper. Do with that information what you will.; Currently pull in 140k base at a mid-level defense contractor. 5 years of experience, with a masters degree. \n\nHowever, the above is in a relatively LCOL area.\n\nCurrently do AI work. \n\nSomeone let me know if I'm getting shafted.; I’m in defense. Just graduated in January and i’m making 110k in NJ. I know a lot of the senior engineers are making minimum 150-200. I think for senior (non manager) positions the pay scale goes up to $240k.; Depends on area. \n\nYou have to realize a lot of legacy defense is in relatively very LCOL areas. In the Bay area starting pay is 90-110k, in somewhere like Ohio or Alabama maybe 75-85k. 5 YOE can hit 150+ fairly reliably with one job hop.\n\n\"Startup-y\" defense is a whole different ball game. Anduril and Palantir pay close to MAANG; ~$240k TC w/ just under 3 yoe. No masters degree, graduated 2021 (multiple internships).\nSwitched jobs in ‘23; I’ve seen a few ranges topping at $180k when I do my quarterly check of JPL openings. But those are like mission critical engineering positions and/or deep applied theory stuff. \n\nThe aerospace/DoD type ancillary companies - think the manufacturing outsourcing types - aren’t too far off for very senior level comp depending on their active projects and funding status. But entry and mid roles, at least a few months ago, were often sub-$100k max but with equity. \n\nThis is west coast HCOL for reference.; There's a LOT of flux in that industry right now.\n\nFresh awards pay WAY better than any long standing award.  Fresh awards will be the upper half of the 1xx range in MCOL for mid and senior devs.  Old awards tend to be low 1xx and have trouble hiring.  Some newer awards break 2xx in HCOL.\n\nI'm not talking TC there, just salary.\n\nThese are what I'm seeing in my partners rate sheets, and some of them are well known names, so I'm probably not far off on the macro.  No, I will not release the actual sheets, nor the names.; 1 yr embedded system. Graduated with bachelors last year and TC 103k working at large defense contractors.; Experienced dev is very vague.\n\n5yoe is hardly experienced anyway.; Greatly depends on how niche your experience is and demand for it. \n\nMilitary grade means \"done by the cheapest people available\". If the air force can do it, it will be done by them and cost practically nothing. If they can't, it will be done by LM, Raytheon or other contractors. If they can't do it, FAANG will do it and charge as much as DoD is willing to give. \n\nDespite having lavish compensation to numb their emotions, there were plenty of people at Microsoft who had to go through counseling after realizing what kind of messed up shit their software was used for.; To provide a mid level (1 yoe + masters) data point, 110k at a large contractor for secret and 140k at a smaller contractor for TS/SCI. Company size and clearance level matter quite a bit.; 3 YOE, HCOL, Lvl 2 engineer in trad defense, 130 base, 3-5% bonus, 10% 401k match, fully remote. Bachelors done, MS in progress.; 4 YOE joined a small defense company last year for 148k base and 3 weeks PTO / 2 weeks sick a year which is pretty generous relative to most places I applied to.\n\nI do get emails from recruiters at other defense companies claiming to be in the 150-200k range fwiw as well; I run a website that uses AI to analyze tech job postings (6j dot gg) and just ran a query in the db:  \nFor jobs that require a security clearance (mostly defense industry) and 1-5 YoE the results are:  \nAverage min. salary: $112,761.44, average max. salary: $182,391.59\n\nFor jobs that require security clearance and 5-10 YoE:  \nAverage min. salary: $144,806.46, average max. salary: $213,755.28"

A large Japanese company does not think or operate like American venture capitalists.\n\nIn terms of stability, it might be a little more stable but not that much.  In terms of moving over to the Japanese parent, that’s dicey unless you can move to an American subsidiary of the Japanese parent (e.g. in my case, U.S. R&D center and U.S. sales org).; How different are we talking? I'd like to hear your opinion, please. I don't live in America but given how prevalent their business practices are in my country, I suppose it's close enough to be a viable form of comparison.; The decision to fund or close the subsidiary startup each year is political, not like a Silicon Valley VC at all.  The Japanese parent is not just an investor; it is also the founder, boss and owns a controlling stake.  The corporate parent company is rich so they can fund money-losing startup forever if they want.  But, even if the startup makes money, they can close it down for any number of political reasons.\n\nThe subsidiary startup always has a \"corporate champion\": a VP-level executive at the corporate parent who convinces the corporate parent to let the startup continue to exist and to give it money if needed.  The champion can change over time.  The champion can tell his bosses total b.s. to keep the startup going because the traditional Japanese execs don't know jack about Silicon Valley.  But, if the startup loses its champion and can't find another, it's over.  They'll just come in and tell your startup's CEO that they are closing down the startup, the CEO is either being transferred or fired and the staff is either transferred or laid off.\n\nThere's no separate founders and investors groups.  The startup CEO isn't like a guy who got an idea, pitched VCs, got investor money and has own big controlling stake in the business.  He can't say \"no\" to the corporate parent.  He's more like a director-level manager: he manages a group of groups and has a tiny equity stake.  His boss is a corporate parent VP, the corporate champion.  The corporate parent rules."

   "Top Comments": "AI Job boom is the most obvious bubble in history. LLMs have a far more limited capability than the hordes of investors realize. A lot of money is getting moved to products that will never do what they've promised. It'll settle into a space much larger than it was 5 years ago. But I definitely wouldn't expect the gravy train to last.; i heard welding is the next big thing; I think you might be conflating a few things.\n\nWhat's happening with LLMs and AI is going to change the world. There is very little doubt in my mind. The types of things we can do today are just absolutely insane and will continue to improve significantly. On the other hand, this is very early days. The models are not great, there are a lot of innovations to come. This is going to take years and years on the core model/training side. Further, we don't know how to turn these things into products just yet, but there are a lot of compelling use cases. The medical sensor fusion aspects, alone are earth changing. But it's going to take 5+ years before we gat a grasp on how we're actually going to use this stuff to be more productive. It isn't just about the capability, but everyone's business processes are going to have to change and that takes a while and is usually a lot more incremental than the step functions like this technology jump gets us.\n\nWhat does this mean for jobs?  We're back into a .com boom. We will have massive and rapid expansion of AI companies. All most all of these will fail. A few will not and they'll take over the lead in Silicon Valley 3.0.  This is what innovation cycles look like and this will be another. \n\n  \nCalling it a boom is reductionist. It's a shift that will take decades to \"complete\". We're at the very beginning and it's going to be interesting to watch.; ?; I have no doubt AI will change the world. And I agree you could compare what's happening today to the .com boom. The internet changed the world too in a massive way.\n\nBut we all know what happened after the .com boom. Investors get a little too eager and its the hard working developers that take the hit when the limitations of LLM becomes too daunting to complete some of the things these companies are promising AI will be able to do.; Certainly ignore the marketing, but the sum total of people working at Internet companies today is far higher than the cannibalized OS and desktop software companies. \n\nThis will grow the market, just in somewhat painful ways because change is painful to the individual (not the industry).; But the point is it wasn't without its growing pains. The dot com bust was one of the worst times to be a programmer. And it is not going to be a great experience for our industry to go through that again. Especially for the people who specialized their career almost entirely in AI.\n\nAll I'm saying is people need to be cautious when deciding how to handle their careers around AI. Lots of uncertainty. And if job stability is your thing it might not be the best field to focus on right now. \n\nIf being on the cutting edge, and \"Changing the world\" is more important to you than job security, though, by all means.; You said it was a bubble, not a shift. The .com burst was not one of the worst times to be a programmer. It didn't last very long and on the other side of it were plenty of jobs at the remaining growth companies. It was a short reset and shift, even calling it a bubble is hugely misleading.\n\nThere will be a shift that happens and it'll be painful as we create and delete a ton of companies. The industry will continue to grow with this new technology, maybe even more so. Entire industries that are not mainly software-based are going to start shifting towards software.\n\nEach year is always the best year to be a software developer. (with the rare exception of having one or two down years). There is no other industry that has better growth."

   "Top Comments": "depends on the company, pair programming companies are a thing, but in my experience majority companies break down the tasks in advance with planning, and you work on your own task separately.; In the real world you'll absolutely have plenty of time to put your headphones on and work by yourself. Soft skills are important nonetheless; You can get away with being a hermit for a while, but ultimately the best software engineers have both strong technical and soft skills.; [deleted]; You are going to suffer. Unlike what people think, a software developer dos not working alone without human interaction. Second, what are you going to do when other devs review your code and put comments in? Are you going to act like your code is the best and hate getting comments? This is what I get here and this is going to clash solidly has code reviews are where you learn the most and are an integral part of the job.; Depends on the company and if you move up the ladder to tech lead for example, your meetings will increase. However, in general, no, it’s not like the bootcamp, you’ll have plenty of alone time.; ime, companies using paired programming is pretty rare. In all likelihood you will be working for a team, but you will only be working with them when planning for new work, doing architecture work, helping/getting help, and maybe code reviews depending how that is done. \n\nHeard people who maintain legacy software are a lot like that. I knew few people who did that just get a task list once a week then heads down work on it alone.; Very team dependent. I sometimes go 1-2 days without even talking to anybody (remote) and even then, it’s just my manager pinging me for something. \n\nIs estimate 30hr of a 35-40hr week is spent alone, coding.\n\nI of course have meetings and the occasional teams ping but for the most part, solo dolo.\n\nLook for a very small team where you’re playing a major role in the implementation. These roles are likely to let you do your thing cause well, we have deadlines.; > I always had this idea of software developers/engineers being on their laptop on their own just building/fixing things. Sure, there could be meetings with managers and the rest of the team to assign duties and whatnot but I thought once you divided up the work it could very much be \"headphones on - doing your own thing and be left alone\".\n\nThis is almost never the case and I blame movies/tv for promoting this 'headphones on, in the zone' reputation for coders. Generally if you are any good at all then lots of people will want/need to talk to you, and the outcomes of these conversations are usually way more important than whatever line of code you were looking at. People who want to hide in a hole and not be bothered don't make good devs.; Pairing programmers in a boot-camp is common and fosters 'collective' learning. Many techies learn by osmosis and find it useful to have a buddy to lean on .\n\nAfter training, most organizations expect developers to fly solo. This said, you may have to attend meetings - daily scrum, conference calls etc and won't always 'work alone'; Pair programming actually makes you dependent on another person. I don’t recommend this ever. \n\nTo answer your question: Yes, its a thing and im the same. No meeting days is perfect work days for me. Im zoned in with no distractions. Don’t go management if you enjoy this; you are in the perfect career; I don't think there is another with a better compensation / interaction ratio.; Very much so the wrong career for that. I work on fairly small projects and the amount of stand ups and involved people is amazingly high. Then again I'm at a consultancy that will cram the last drop out of the offer they won obviously. I am self-taught and my learning curve has been exponential until I actually started working in this field and now I am almost going backwards in my personal development. Forced into a crowded office working in overly complex solutions for what is basically very simple problems is just not worth it in the long run. Luckily I have another career to fall back on when opportunity presents itself!; Not at all.\nAll learnings should be done independently. Pair programming can be helpful for seniors to coach juniors.\nSocial skills are helpful in a war room scenario.; Pairing for 6 hours a day is actually pretty rare - even at companies where pairing is part of the culture. I've also seen that it's common for juniors to pair with seniors, as a way to ramp them in.\n\nOverall - you'll be fine, because there's plenty of room for devs that just want to dev.\n\nBut at the same time, if you are ambitious and want those crazy staff/principal engineer salaries - the tech chops aren't what gets you there. Getting those jobs is about the interpersonal and inter-team big picture stuff. It's tough to break $200k without either solid demonstrable people skills or a lucky specialization. But there are plenty of well-paid jobs under that.; Which unfortunately is a very suboptimal manner of working out complex problems. In your corner of isolation you only have a small scope of visibility on the broader problem. Business needs and circumstances can change too quickly for this to be an agile/flexible strategy.; Ah yes, the knights of gloom and doom, I was wondering when one of you would show up; I never said I can’t interact with humans at all lol, I just said I don’t want to spend my whole day having to interact with people…\n\nIf I have to have meetings or talk about my code that’s more than fine, I just don’t want to be paired/in a group the whole day unable to just code on my own. Very different things.; Your job is writing code. That is what you're going to do majority of the time.\n\n  \nNow if you get promoted your role will change.; It also does depend on the company.\n\nI started with this mentality, just to end up being stuck in meetings at least half of my workday almost every day."

So just be patient; I feel like people should just use LLMs on coding assignments which would drastically reduce the time needed.

Saves a ton of time, helps you achieve what you want to achieve and what they want to see, which is your vision, attention to detail, definition of done, etc. They can test your ability to write code without help during a technical interview.; Sorry OP, the SWE hiring process/job hunt for new grad roles has always been shit. It’s extra shit right now due to the overall economy.      \nDon’t take it personally.

I didn't realize the hiring manager emailed me back to schedule a time to talk to him for a week because it went to my spam box. I responded back and left him a voicemail a few days afterwards, but haven't heard anything since.\n\nI'm not excited about the company at all, I don't like the location 12 hours away from here, and the role itself is a dev job when I've been doing my best to move on to something else like a PO, BA, OR QA role, but I've been unemployed for over a year at this point and feel terrible living with my parents. The feeling that I very well may have fucked myself out of a job because of my spam inbox is killing me.; I’ve been applying for every development position at a specific company that opens up because I’d really like to work for them. I don’t really believe in “dream jobs” but at this stage in my career (1.5 YoE) it’s exactly what I’m looking for and in a location I’d much prefer to live in. So far, I’ve received nothing but rejection emails. I’m considering paying for LinkedIn premium and messaging people that already work there to ask for advice on how to make my resume more appealing to them, and for things I could do to work on developing my skills to make me a better fit.\n\nIs that a good idea? I’m trying to reverse the situation and imagine how I’d feel if someone did that to me and I think I’d be flattered, but I’m not sure.; Hi all,\n\nI really want to aim for a bank-end SWE role in the retail banking sector (Like C1). I’ve scoped out the postings but they seem to be all over the place. Does anyone know what they specifically look for in regard to language and stack proficiency? Are there any other proficiencies that are focused on more compared to other industries?\n\nI’d be applying as an upper end junior. I know the market is bad. I don’t care. I currently have a job and am more than willing to wait it out for a few years and develop my skills more in the meantime.\n\nThanks!; > 3 mo contract\n\nrecruiter: what's risky about it?; worth a shot.  I dunno flattered, but worst case, they ghost/reply rudely.  Median case, non committal reply, best case, conversation/recommendation.  I don't see why not.  I have done the same, I've gotten recommendations (very few, out of a lot of tries), but I don't think I got a job out of any of them.  But that's probably only because I also ping recruiters and people tagged on job listings, and those people respond more, and I eventually took an offer from one of those interactions.; I suppose absolute worst case would be they get annoyed at me and make sure I don't get interviews even if I would have gotten one. But I have a hard time imagining being mad enough at someone on LinkedIn to do that. But other than that you're right, there's not much reason not to try. I'm certainly not expecting a reference, just some advice.; Oh I wouldn't EXPECT reference.  But I'd ask for one depending on how the convo goes.  Back when the big companies were doing a lot of none-role-specific hires, I'd just ask anyone from my uni, regardless of how many years ago it was for them.  \"Hey, senior whatever whose been at this place 8 years.  I'm trying to get my foot in the door.  I have xyzabc experience, and would love to work on service123, product456 or any number of whatever.  Would it be possible for you to ask around if for recruiter or HM with open headcounts if they'd be interested in talking to me?\" etc etc\n\nI got nice rejections, shitty rejections, mostly ghosted, a few conversations about the uni, and a couple of references.  Don't be afraid to ask.  Even if they take it badly, you got nothing to feel bad about unless you were being a dick through how you asked.; Thank you! I wasn't even intending to ask, but if I get a good conversation with someone I'll do so now. I've got no problem with dealing with rejection, so far that's all I've got from this company but I'm going to continue putting my resume in every chance I get anyway.; best of luck! took me a lot longer to learn some of these lessons, so glad I saved someone a few hours...or days...or worse."

But you have to be very good at your job AND the firm has to be profitable. There is zero hiding and a lot of it is outside your control.; Assume COL grows with salary. Then: 2x everything => 2x savings / wealth building as well.; Quants are bookmakers. It’s insanely profitable. But good luck if you think the average *smart* person has a shot at that gig.; Let’s say an entry level quant job pays a little over 300k TC in NYC. If you max out your 401k at 22.5k, your income tax liability is around 106k, so cut that down to 180k TC post tax/401k. You get a nice apartment that’s 4k a month for 50k total. Food let’s say $60 a day, ignoring any free food that might be provided at work. $132 a month for unlimited metro swipes.   \nYou’re now at $108.5k left over after 401k, transportation, housing, and food.   \n   \nLet’s say your apartment in Houston is $1.5k a month instead of $4k, you spend $30 a day on food instead of $60, and transportation fees (car payment, insurance, gas, maintenance) averages out to $300 a month.   \nTo have the same amount left over annually, you would need to be making about $210k in Houston using these hypothetical figures.; Yes. I have never worked in fintech but I have gotten recruiter email with “$1m+” in the title. A lot of is pref bonus I’ve heard and the bonus trickle down from the success of the project (usually alpha); Quant means a million things, and unless you nail down what you are talking about, it's almost meaningless. Some people call any software work at a trading firm 'quant,' while others mean specifically portfolio management/trading/research scientist (this is where the real money is, and it's a totally different ladder than generic software engineering). Others reference highly specialized infrastructure work.\n\nThe generic software engineering stuff is higher paying than most jobs, but generally speaking not higher than Meta or some others tier1s.\n\nAs for earning more than in Houston, etc, yeah. Cost of living calculations are largely bullshit, just lipstick on the pig of median household/rent prices; My new grad offer for one of (HRT, Jane Street, Citadel) was $450k - half bonus, half base. This was SWE, quant is more like $600k.  So yes. ; I knew a guy who was making well over 600k fresh out of university at Five Rings. If there's a field where recent undergraduates get paid more than MD's at Investment Banks, Partners at Law firms, attending Physicians in medicine, and VP's at Private Equity, I'd say it's higher paying, yes.\n\nNote, this is for quant devs, who earn the least in the \"front office\" of Quantitative trading. It is very common for quantitative researchers / traders to pull 1m+ annually.; In my personal professional experience working with companies like Optiver and Virtu, most quants are Phd's or/and very experienced in that industry by accident, it's very unlikely you will get a job as a quant, money is usually a wrong motivator to choose a niche, just saying. \n\nAll real HFT is done by FPGA these days too. All the rest has been migrated from C++ to Java over the last 10 years.; [deleted]; They are higher but depends on the company as well; They pay decently. It usually depends on the company.

A lot of the money comes from profit sharing from the trading strats.\n\nI'm a managing partner clearing about 2/3m per month.; you bum; yeah, it is. Especially long term. Quants can make 350k new grad, 1m+ after 5-6 years at top firms. \n\nThere are also quant jobs in Houston FWIW. Two sigma.; Pardon the ignorance, but what is the educational path for someone to break into that? It would seem to me the math and statistics of a computer science degree would be insufficient.; Chicago has probably even more jobs and it’s super cheap compared to the classic tech hubs; Man, reading all the comments are making me depressed lol; There is extreme survivorship in those jobs.

Micromanagers and narcissists don't generally realize they're that, so they proudly state their management style thinking it's gonna come off great.\n\nI also generally ask a few questions about how the team balances tech debt, what the biggest challenge facing the team is, an example of a time when the team missed a deadline and what was done in reaction to that, etc.\n\nI don't think it's super useful if we give you *our* questions.

   "Title": "Company wants me to learn a low code platform and perform api integration tasks, even though they say they look for backend developer. Is this a scam? ",
   "Top Comments": "Get the offer first before worrying about anything else. Especially with how hard it is to get internships now.; They’re probably just clueless\n\nYes mulesoft isn’t very employable but a job is a job, it’s more employable than being unemployed; I'm currently in a similar situation. I just started a new role as a BSA after working as a SWE for 4 years. My new role requires me to perform the tasks of a BA and a SWE. They're using an unpopular low code platform called PowerBuilder which I am required to learn. For myself, I'm trying to make a transition from a development role to a business/management role so I'm trying to develop my skills outside of programming. A good thing is that this low code platform runs on C# and .NET and sometimes we have to write custom modules so I do still need code once in a while. You may also need to write custom code for the platform but it won't be as often as compared to a pure SWE role.; Disclaimer: this is just my *perception* of mulesoft, I could be completely wrong about this.\n\nI went to a talk once, titled \"manage your rest apis\" or something, so I was thinking it was just some tips and tricks for better api management when building rest services, right?\n\nTurns out it was just a sales pitch for mulesoft. I don't think doing a talk on proprietary software at a conference about mostly open source software is the best way to go about things. The speaker also didn't seem very confident and you could tell she didn't have much experience. I kinda felt sorry for her she had to do this. The fact she was Indian also didn't help, I've heard nothing but bad things about Indian work culture which only made me even feel more sorry for her.\n\nSo to me, this whole mulesoft business seems shady and I'd stay as far away from it as possible.; In low code and no code development, developer wear multiple hats. So the integration and application layer is part of the backend development. Sometimes companies have separate people for each role but more than likely they do not. Most companies do not know how to hire for these roles because developers usually see low code and become uninterested. \n\nSo they probably didnt mention it in the ad. It very well may be an integrator role, but they need someone with back and skills in order to execute it. And if that is this case, scam is a very strong word.\n\nI don’t know if this is a scam, but I think you should follow through. Low code is where the workforce and all Tech companies are going. Good luck.; 1.this is not the time to be picky\n\n2, Why do you want to reinvent the wheel by writing useless code? you will learn alot by using mulesoft, I am sure you will get something to code to customize as well\n\nI use ETL tools to avoid rewriting code, reading/writing from excel/DB, API's is very redundant and it saves me time, I still have to think about design/logic.\n\nIMO this is where we heading, it sounds like a good opportunity to me, you should be able to deliver alot in this internship, if you want to write stupid APIs in java you can do on your time for learning, its not hard.; Hey, this is in my domain so I can help. I work a lot with Salesforce and such, so I can give some insight.\n\n\nFirst, you need to have a little understanding of Salesforce. Salesforce is huge, and can be extremely lucrative. They have always positioned and sold themselves as \"no software\", \"low code\", etc. Out of the box, it can do a ton of things, but more often than not customer/client wanting it needs a lot of customization/configuration to make it fit their specific needs. I've been working with it for nearly 10 years, and I write code every single day, and lots of it. The \"low-code\"/\"no-code\" is only true for super small organizations that need a few things done, it isn't the case for the rest. It does eliminate a lot of boilerplate things, though - such as needing to do stand up databases, repositories/DALs, etc. Adding new \"tables\", fields, simple automation, is just a few clicks and a few seconds away, but real logic can be done programmatically. It has some pros and cons like many tech stacks, but the \"low code\" thing is a misnomer. \n\nThere are different layers in the Salesforce ecosystem, most people ultimately end up being a typical \"full stack\" developer. There can be, and often is, a lot of custom front-end work, but there is what they call \"back end\" work. Backend is their term for anything that isn't UI or typically customer facing. You aren't likely going to standup microservices or run your own server, but if the client/customer is big enough - you just may (i.e. Heroku). \n\nThe truth about Salesforce is that due to their years of marketing this Low Code bullshit, it never attracted good, true, developers. So what you ended up with are a bunch of office admins that tinkered with the platform long enough where they started writing/tweaking a little code, and ultimately becoming self-proclaimed developers. They end up making an absolute mess in the client environments and you end up with a platform that runs like absolute garbage, ultimately building a reputation by end-users saying \"my company uses salesforce and it sucks!\". Yeah, probably because your company paid an admin with a degree in geology to hack together some junk and now you can't do your job. Compound that with the fact most users are business oriented, non-technical, so anything technical they refer to as \"developer work\". Now we are here... where anything that isn't UI is \"backend\" and anything technical is \"development\". So tools like Mulesoft, where it is mostly drag and drop ETL integration, you're now a \"backend developer\". \n\nMulesoft is a juggernaut integration tool. I personally despise it, as there are cheaper, more configurable, lightweight ETLs. It is overkill for most customer needs but they end up buying it anyway, and usually pay 250k+ per year for the privilege of accessing it. If your customer is buying a Mulesoft license then they have money to blow. \n\nIf you like that kind of stuff then it can be a great opportunity.\n\nThe true redflag here is that this \"consulting group\" is wanting to hire an intern to do a Mulesoft integration. Mulesoft \"developers\" make, on average, around $150k. \n\n\nAnyway, if you have any questions around the Salesforce platform, ecosystem, or consulting, I'm happy to answer.; I've used Mulesoft in the past and its great for a specific use case: integrations which seems to be the job you re describing; I'm making this post coz I've another java ee + spring(maybe)  opportunity\n\nAnyway thanks for the answer; I'm making this post coz I've another java ee + spring(maybe)  opportunity\n\nAnyway thanks for the answer; I see. Now it looks like the java EE legacy code position is far better for me. For now at least I want to write programs. Thansk!; PowerPlan? Don't know who else uses powerbuilder.; Thanks. This is an European company (I live in Europe) but from stories I've seen on the internet there have been students who got tricked into accepting mulesoft intern positions as they were promised to do \"java\" \"api\" \"spring\" and thought this would boost their careers, only to find out that they would be using a low code platform that's very niche and would only make them much less appealing to hrs who filter resumes by keywords and don't understand sh**\n\nThat's why I'm very concerned about this offer; Thanks. I said scam because I said very clearly in my mail that I'm interested in a developer (programmer) role, and the hr confirmed that this is indeed backend developer\n\nHowever as you and others said it, this is much more likely to be an integrator role. Technically it's still backend and not frontend, but integrators don't code or develop programs that much. Instead I've said and they've confirmed that this is a programmer role\n\nSo this is a bit of word play going on and I feel like a scam. If I wasnt wary enough I can very well ruin my career before it even starts; nah, OP is young and has the financial flexability of no mortgage/family/kids depending on their income, live the college life for an extra year to find a good job to setup their career. \n\n  \nwaay way back in 2002 or so when i was in a similar spot in a similar economy, i was offered what was essentially a VBA/excel job by the local power company (glamorous!) i turned it down because even in a shit economy it was a bad job that i didn't want on my resume. they were polite but confused, it all worked out fine.; Lol, 🤣 yet everyone else says that mulesoft or Salesforce will only pigeonhole you \n\nI'm making this post coz I've another java ee + spring opportunity; And I don't understand why you despise apis written by java and describe them as stupid. Dude you can't be serious. Useless code? Why you say useless? \n\nYou look like a Salesforce/low code platform enthusiast to me; Thanks really so much for this response. It's very detailed. Now I think I kinda understand what this consulting firm is looking for: they work for big clients and these big companies are prolly buying lots of this software from them, and this consulting firm is on shortage of people who can use mulesoft\n\nConsidering that I want to become a full-stack developer who write code to build programs, would you say that this is a good opportunity ? Or I should take the other opportunity from a very small consulting firm (8 swes, lol) that uses obsolete technologies, but that at least will let me codr?\n\nThank you so much for the help already, thank you!; A couple of questions if you don't mind :\n\n1- Are there many in-house jobs in SF or is it mostly consulting?\n\n2 -Also is it possible to focus on just either frontend or backend in that ecosystem, or will you be forced to do both?\n\n3- I've heard people often say that SF devs are part dev part BA, is that true?\n\n4- What are your main pain points with SF?\n\n  \nThx; I’m glad that you clarified, but you definitely have a right to wary"

Building even the tiniest feature or any feature request no matter how trivial was r&d. I think in the end they calculated that only 1 out of the 5 engineers on the team would not be classified as full time r&d meaning they could deduct 4 out of the 5 engineers salary entirely; R&D salaries are still tax deductible, it's just over 5 years rather that one year. \n\nThere is an upfront cost, but it evens out over time.

   "Top Comments": "I worked at Bloomberg before, and overall I enjoyed my time there. You can expect your starting salary to be similar to what you see on [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) for new grads. Starting salary is pretty much FAANG equivalent, but it will take a long time to even hit 300K TC for most people who started at the company.\n\nOverall, the work life balance is great in most teams, and really good benefits. Some technologies you use are more likely to be in-house, but that won't prevent you from studying outside of work if you are passionate about it. Bloomberg will also pay for grad school (12K per year) and your CFA exams depending on what you are more interested in.\n\nMy two cent is I would humbly say Bloomberg is a very respectable first job. It won't hurt to join unless you can get better offers. Learn some things, see if you like what you are doing and how much you are getting paid. You can always decide to hop once you think your time there is done.; If you have an internship, take it. Bloomberg is snooty on which schools it hires from and for full time SWEs, your immediately preceding company.; Internships do not mean anything in the long term (after your first new graduate job) so do any internship you can get, and when you have multiple internship offers, do the one that sounds cooler. The most important part of any internship is that you enjoy it.\n\nDon't worry about the return offer or the company if you're multiple years away. Things will change; u serious? they dont have layoff?? one of my friend just got laid off 2 months ago.; Hey thanks for the response!\n\nThis is my freshman year internship lol so I do have lots of time to re recruit, just wondering if it’ll be worth the risk later on to take a riskier but higher TC company, which might have lower return offer rates (I’m international so I need sponsorship so I can’t really be empty handed after grad, but I am an Australian citizen so I’ll get a green card quite quickly). I’ll probably take the risk for HF/quant but not sure otherwise\n\nIf you don’t mind, how were the exit opps for you after Bloomberg? Could you pivot into FAANG type companies or quant, and how was the resume value?; Thanks! I think all the Reddit doomer posts might be getting to me cuz I’ve just been thinking about guaranteeing a job honestly (like bouncing return intern offers until NG). \n\nLife’s gonna change a lot in the next few years I think I’ll just see what happens and take the best I can get; The interviewer (EM) said they’ve never had structural layoffs (like whole teams) and only ever cut bottom 5-10% performers; I am at a FAANG now, and I have many coworkers who were ex-bloomberg. I would say it will look good on your resume, and I would dare to say it may be better than one particular company in FAANG as well. I still think it is not as recognized as other big names, but a lot of people got into FAANG or better with Bloomberg on their resume.; I worked for 2 competitors to Bloomberg and there are always clients and or investment shops that love that you know the markets and can code, especially if you have time actually in a niche(I worked in portfolio optimization and back testing). Most finance grads don't do options or fixed income but Bloomberg is very strong here as a tool and with the markets it makes here. \n\nSince you are so early in your academic career I would absolutely try a series of different types of shops and locations to see what you like.; Your priorities in college should go as follows: Just graduate -> Make a lot of memories. Take up any opportunities that sound cool, don't ever be \"too cool\" for something -> Make some mistakes (this is gonna happen) and learn from them -> Do well in school (after your first job, no one cares about your GPA).\n\nIf you're starting to feel like you're reading a lot of doomer, negative things, get off Reddit/the internet and remember that 99.9% of the time the posts/things on the internet don't actually effect YOUR life.\n\nGood luck.; if the em said so, well, there is “no pip” over there.\n\nbtw, my friend worked over for 6 years. As a senior, perhaps he really was that bad. lol"

Anything else is a real crap shoot.; Good to know! I think python will probably be good to know either way, but I guess I'll do more research before I devote a lot of time to an endeavor that won't lead where I want it.; Languages are pretty tertiary. Beginners tend to think it’s really important how many languages you know. If you want a good impression of what a CS degree looks like, look into data structures, discrete math, and CS50 from Harvard; Well I'll be able to use python in my current role, so it won't be wasted time if making a transition turns out to be a wash. Are you of the same opinion that a 4 year degree is required? Because that's not realistically something I'd do if I had to go back to school full time.; I’m guessing you don’t already have a degree? You could see if Revature / Skillstorm / Dev10 would take you.\n\nBut otherwise, yeah you would need one. It’s not something you should be doing half heartedly ; I have a BFA, but I'm not sure much would transfer over other than some basic gen-eds if I were to go back to school. I took some calculus at a local college afterwards in preparation to go back to school but ended up getting a better job with decent pay.\n\nI'm just not sure it makes financial sense to quit my job and get a CS degree unless I could come out making like 150k off the bat. Unfortunately I don't think my job would pay for a degree in CS and they don't have roles in that field.; That’s a pretty high bar for salary and I wouldn’t make it an expectation.\n\nIf you like the subject, I’d say go for it. But it sounds like you’re more interested in the short term monetary gains and finances rather than the subject itself.\n\nCS is much more likely to ramp up in salary compared to your current role though. I think if you get an internship during a masters degree, you could make up that gap; >making like 150k off the bat\n\nThis is very, very unlikely.; If you already have a degree, you could look into post bacc programs like osu or do an online masters like omscs. I was able to finish the osu program in a year by focusing on it full time.\n\n\nI still wouldn't recommend teaching yourself with the way the job market is currently but being able to check the box on applications that says you have a college degree would make going that route less impossible. ; Honestly, yeah, I'm most interested in making the highest amount of money with the best benefits and work life balance I can achieve in 5 years. I love manufacturing, but this field just doesn't offer that. I like computers and what little programming I've done so I thought it could be a good avenue for me. Are people picky about colleges?

Not sure what you mean by being locked into this job for 1.5 years but having income > no income while looking for your next SWE job.\n\nAlso, 3 months severance is sick for having only been there for a year so that's nice; You got two months notice and three months severance after being there as a Jr for a year? That sounds like bullshit; $50 CAD says this is big blue and you got RA’d. Sorry this happened to you so early in your career.; If you cannot find a real swe job then living on the streets is less humiliating than working at a non swe job.

I guess I’m just kinda worried about the job market and not sure if I should focus elsewhere.\n\nGet off the internet. Reddit is no where near a reflection of reality. I've gotten two jobs, interviewed for many more and none of them were via referrals. Redditors love to complain and come up with reasons why they can't do things instead of foucsing on how they can do things. Networks and relationships don't create themselves, you have to work at them. \n\nMy biggest advice is: If you like it, keep going. If you don't like it, change course. You don't want to be stuck doing a job for 40 years you hate. Regardless if it's in software or not.; OP, better than taking peoples word on here as fact, test it out yourself. Go apply for jobs as if you have a degree. Just don't take the interviews if you get them. See how many apps it takes to get a job interview.\n\nThen decide if that is what you are willing to tolerate. Its easy for people on here to tell you \"just keep doing it if you enjoy it\". Yeah, that is what a lot of millennials were told too when they got history degrees, because \"it doesn't matter what degree you get, as long as you enjoy the degree\". \n\nBack in reality, you need to really decide if what you hear on here is worth it to you. I can tell you right now, their are people graduating with degrees in CS who can't land a job. People on here even posted about going into another field because they couldn't keep waiting.\n\nI can't tell you what the future holds for this field. I can only offer that you see what is correctly happening in the field yourself by seeing it firsthand. Apply for jobs and see whats its like right now for new grads.\n\nAgain, I'm not telling you what to do. I am also not telling you what the job field will look like in a couple of years. I don't know, and I doubt many on reddit know either. I am simply saying you should explore this on your own by applying for jobs now as if you graduated and see what the responses you get back are from companies. Companies won't lie to you about the job market right now, but redditors will lie to you.\n\nI can tell you that I know people in other fields and they are not putting up with the same job market that CS people are putting up with right now.; >I really do enjoy the coding and math.\n\nThat's all I needed to hear.\n\nYou are the kind of people that crush this industry.; it’s who you blow; [removed]; First the networking thing is demonized for obvious reasons.\n\nFor us mortals networking is .\n\n1) at the college level, don't make enemies of your schoolmates,.also don do stupid shit.i have blocked two guys from.my college days from getting jobs where I have worked because: guy a would also people to loan him stuff/money and he would never give it back, you don't want to work with a person like that. Guy b worked as a cashier while studying he once bragged about \"smelling\" when people are in a hurry, so he would give them incorrect change and pocket the difference, I also do not want to work with that kind of guy.\n\nAlso it helps a lot of your school mates know you are good.\n\n2) once you start working , the don't be stupid rule applies, now you also want to prove to them you are good, idiots do it by bragging, emotionally clever people do it by helping other people.qhen they get stuff and by sharing their knowledge. That way when they leave you have a network of co-workers who can vouch for you; from the pov of the company they work for now, that means you are a smaller risk when hiring than hiring a random from the street.\n\nAlso, when people leave the work ( in the good/normal times) they tend to go for better jobs, so you definitely want to have one foot inside.; Agree with this, and let me also emphasize even more than what you see here on Reddit, or on click-bait YouTube videos saying that \"The end is near\" is NOT reflective of what's really going on everywhere. I personally do not believe in a lot of these \"500+ or 1000+ applications sent and no interview or offers\" stories. I have more stories from friends who have put in 10 or 15 applications before the first interview/offer. Althogh, they are a bit more experienced.\n\nYou have two years, the market has plenty of time to correct itself in that time. Like u/howdoiwritecode  said, do it if you love it, and don't kill yourself with debt if you can help it. Even in a worst case scenario where SWE is not as lucrative as it once was, or it's hard to find a job, that degree will still open a lot of doors that can take you farther than not having it. You'd be surprised at the people with amazing jobs that do not fit their degree in the real world.\n\nAlso, assuming you're not married or have any children, don't be afraid to move away for a good opportunity either when it comes to looking. Everybody loves being at home, but some of the best opportunities call you away and you can always come back or maybe even negotiate working remotely if you work there long enough (if it isn't already remote to begin with).; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

There’s on the answer you choose. So no matter what you do, just be okay with what you decide until you’re not happy with it.; What type of doors or jobs can a CS degree open that are not related to the field?; Good question, I probably should have thought more about that in my answer or given examples. I've known a few people who transitioned into teaching, business (sales), or banking roles (math). The essence I was trying to say is that there are many jobs that may \"require\" a four year degree, but they aren't super strict on what it is to perform the job. Obviously I wouldn't expect that to be the first choice after completing a CS degree, but these are options during hard times. Again, worst case.\n\nEdit:\n\nIt also goes the same way for other engineering roles to something like CS. I've seen electrical and mechanical engineers move to CS type jobs, however that may be less of a stretch. I've also seen philosophy majors become devs too lol; Every job is related, but the day to day will be significantly different than a SWE. After a few years in the industry (even just 2), you can move into a more “traditional” project/product manager role, doors in finance open to bring in your technical knowledge for investments, IT, etc. pretty much anyone who uses software could benefit from a few years out CS grad with some dev under their belt. "

If you want to be a math professor, you need a math PhD. So start studying for the GRE. Get a good score volunteer at a high school or something to get good letters of rec. Then find a program your interested in reach out to find out how to get competitive. They might also have a few undergrad requirements.; Funny I dropped my cs double major in undergrad, went to grad school for a math phd, realized I didn’t want to be poor and am a dev now anyway.  \n\n Why get a masters in math and try to find a more mathy software role? \n\nThere are lots of them in the defense industry. ; Do you understand the primary duty of a professor — that it is not merely to know a subject or teach it, but to create new knowledge about it?; You can do anything in this life, the main thing is that you have free time and can combine both activities. I know people who studied at a university, worked 2-3 jobs and managed to do everything everywhere, but again I don’t advise you to overload, otherwise you can burn out wherever you can. Listen to your heart.; U should look into more mathy swe roles also -\nLike quant, AI/ML, scientist roles at tech co etc. U would make bank then eventually can on the side pursue teaching and set urself up for a good future. Plus those roles have lotta math I think. Also research about academia - it doesn’t pay much from what I’ve heard but do ur research and find out about the career prospects that way.; An option is to look for work with scientific software. Could be a software application developer. But also a lot of government work in that area (DoD, NASA). Having math and software skills is very valuable to the right employers.; Most of math PHDs have to work with python or R. Unless you are strictly teaching math, you might still be working as a soft dev in over way or other.; Talk to people at graduate program, fulfill the prerequisites and application requirements, apply and go through the program.\n\nThe process is straight forward, no need to make big deal ou of it.; Do you have any recommendation on how to start studying math again, or is this a better question for google?; Agreed with this advice. Some schools don't even require the GRE. OP should shop around for graduate schools, see what their requirements are for admittance, get in touch with their coordinates, and go from there.; As a math major who did research I feel obligated to point out that you are definitely not looking at poverty wages after completing a PhD in math. All of the PhDs I know have ended up doing really weird and interesting work, for a very comfortable salary. It might not be comparable to typical compensation OP might have with that many years extra of SWE experience, but it's certainly significantly better than poverty wages.\n\n\nI will say that becoming a professor is widely considered a real longshot, even among my most dedicated peers. Maybe if you have a pedigree and can expect to hear from some presitigious universities, your outlook might look marginally better.\n\n\nEdit: I would also like to anticipate what I would very likely guess any older academics might opine about OP's hopes: older academics are in my experience greatly encouraging of PhD prospectives, and are often out of touch with the current graduate school application process, unfamiliar with the dreadful consequences of a bad die-roll for an advisor, or ignorant of the state of the professor market.\n\n\n It is also worth noting that there are many college campuses in america where the graduate students are in active rebellion over their living conditions.; Do you really think all the math profs are meaningfully contributing to math research outside of like the top unis? This isn’t a rhetorical question; What makes you say this? I'd say that programming experience is the exception among math professors, excluding basic stuff like LaTeX. They would only do programming if their research requires it, and even then they might get someone else to do it for them in some cases.; Start with books that teach you how to prove. Then do introductory books from: real analysis,  linear algebra, geometry, discrete mathematics, probabilities and differential equations. Important part is to do exercises and proofs. \n\n\nDepending on your interests move forward from there. This is basically what you would be doing your first-second semester anyways. There are good self study guides on the dedicated math subreddits. My suggestion is not to overspecialise initially even if one of subjects does not click. Many of the math fields cross-polinate, so having a basic grasp of stuff you would be taught in undergrad is important. \n\n\n Do train not just for understanding but for speed too. You shouldnt need to think about the basic integration differentiation matrix and vector multiplication various common real analysis proofs etc. it needlesly slows down your learning when every time the author skips a step you become lost dur to basica. The more advanced book the less typically they explain the intermediate steps.   \n\n\n There is plenty of math that involves computer science. Many of my applied math professors actually completed computer science phds and are working in applied math department. So, use that knowledge to your advantage. \n\n\n After a year or two of independent studying(depends on how time you spend every day) find a field that interests you, cover the intermediate-advanced material in that field and start interacting with people who are doing research . This is by far the best way get into graduate research program. There are plenty of math departments who would take motivated computer science grads. \n\n\n I cant help with pure math as this type of program is not present here, so I never had opportunity to interact with professors who were doing pure math research. Doing pure math would likely be very difficult as computer science grad but do note that most people specialise and often can barely solve simple problems from outside their domain. Getting good in one specific field is never out of question. ; Start off with https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Advanced-Mathematics-Third-Textbooks/dp/1439898340 and see how that feels. I got my degree in math and did some grad work. Feel free to DM me; I agree with everything you said, but I think the person you're replying to meant poverty wages while in graduate school obtaining the PhD, not after graduation, which is very true in the majority of cases.; It's a good question. I think when we consider any profession we think of the diligent and bright examples. And tend to forget that any profession has a ton of merely average people who just get by doing minimum work. Sure being a math prof at Stanford might require lots of original work. Being a math prof as some backwoods community college probably not so much.; I think that publishing research is not limited to the \"top unis\" and is an expectation for tenure and advancement."

Learning how to talk the least amount possible to prevent any issues at work.\n\nSounds dumb but office speak is so important as a Senior and you want to have it mastered by then.\n\nNow, actual SWE stuff would be learning skills that carry over to other jobs (learning CI/CD, testing tools, leadership, debugging quicker, how services communicate, end to end testing, being able to validate your code changes on multiple angles)\n\nAlso, start building your network and reconnecting with friends with SWE, with this 💩 market you’re gonna need referrals.; Get another role.

I feel somewhat blessed because a) I completed my conversion degree in compsci with barely any sleep (noisy asshats and other shit) b) got a 3 month internship right after graduating, then a 3 month job at some low code place and finally dealing with actual code with my current place\n\nWith my current place it’s a bit of a Wild West because initially had to deal with legacy php code. Now I’m tasked to do mainly the frontend side of things with another dev who is mainly backend. Thankfully I have learned to be mindful of implementing best practises. It feels like I’m a mid dev despite being junior because a lot of my work is down to me. That and we don’t have defined deadlines lol\n\nAs I say, I feel I’m just grinding it out so that I can confidently say “yes, I have 1 year of commercial dev experience”. I know some people from my course that are struggling to get a dev job until this day. A couple are doing year long internships but majority aren’t. I’m happy I just somehow jumped straight into commercial rather than interning. It’s a bit stressful but I’m holding my own; beautiful answer 🔥🔥 i would love to add for myself i usually set timers, like think about this one service and all its use cases in 30-40 mins and explain to a rubber duck. afterwards check it in with a trusted source. Imo it prepares you to sell a story about a certain tech as well makes you more knowledgeable about the subject; Is it not already standard? Most places I interviewed had technicals ; I mean the legacy PHP used a weird mix of OOP and something else. I did Java for my course. Read that it is somewhat similar. Actually, was considering of getting certified in C (it is a legit cert btw); Yep that is my aim for sure ; I have a conversion MSc in CompSci; After 9 months?!?; Could you please expand ? I am legit writing it from the ground up and even will have a bit of AWS experience. The PHP stuff will be unloaded to another dev next month; Already got that ; If the market was what it was during Covid I would have said just jump ship and get hands on experience in something more up to date somewhere, but at the moment is kind of though out there. Typescript is surely beneficial for your career as it’s not going anywhere,nor is Node so you are already upskilling on the job. If you can I would look at some cloud provider experience AWS or Azure. If you have the bandwidth get a side project going with nextJS + tailwind deployed on a cloud provider, but don’t stress yourself too much the whole knowledge come organically if you work well, and funny enough your feelings about the knowledge are gonna shape in a bell curve where both ends are “ I don’t know shit”"

False.; Because, as soon as they talk to you, they are going to understand what your background is. That, and the fact that it's fraud to misrepresent yourself to get a job, especially when you'll have to lie to the company doing your background check.\n\nThat said, lots of people go from less prestigious companies to FAANG. It happens all the time, especially for people entering the field without a degree.; I never worked at big tech and couldn't get rid of the recruiters in my DM last year and even a dozen or so this year (2021 was wild I don't even want include that as it was an outlier). 5 YOE at a F500. I don't think it's hard to get an interview at big tech at all and the rest is just your skills; VP at a bank is usually mid-senior at FAANG, so just title inflation/a reason to be able to pay higher and compete with tech. ; Just practice Leetcode and prepare for interviews.; Microsoft and Salesforce both pay more though. My friend’s Salesforce offer was higher, and my offer from MSFT was initially slightly lower (~5k) until I matched it with another offer and it was much higher (~40k). The hiring manager said they rarely even match Amazon offers because 95% of the time people still chose Microsoft even at less comp.\n\n\nAnd Amazon’s benefits are by far the worst in big tech unfortunately. You lose out on so much money (~10k/yr) from a nearly nonexistent 401k benefit and a bunch of other random things. If your Microsoft comp is the same as your Amazon comp, you’re actually losing like 20k in cash every year by working at Amazon.; This is the best argument I have seen against what I wrote.\n\nEven with all the negativity around amazon, I have to admit that they are generally really good about giving a larger number of applicants opportunities and great exit opportunities.\n\nI guess this is why they are referred to as a gateway.\n\nEdit: I am not necessarily talking about the big 5 (FAANG I cringe to write it at this point).

From what I read, tech companies want juniors because of their potential and ability to mold them.  Regardless of what you make of this, if a more senior person applied to a new grad program, they would be denied on the spot.\n\nIf a senior person were to apply to a mid level role, he/she would be competing against many others with large tech experience.; If you don't know anybody getting a job without work experience, why would you suggest omitting your work experience to get a job?; Okay dude.

What you are asking is a dream that Youtubers/Instagramers have sold you. And/or some redditors just lying for likes or just lying to the government through VPNs and all (and hope to not get caught aka illegal).\n\nThe only other option is to set up your own company and pay taxes appropriately. Basically a contract hire of your own company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, the hours are not sustainable let alone the people who do this are generally... well, almost always it's illegal (and for the companies, they could lose a lot of money at the federal level). Federal laws and all.\n\nAll it takes is .... someone notifying the government or company about this and that person will lose his/her job.; I know one. \n\nShe works for a small company and has been there 6 years. A very high performer so they are lenient.; If you have specialized, experienced, senior+ skillset and experiences, you can work out any working arrangement with many companies.\n\nI knew a specialist in OS development that made $$$Millions in stock options and was about to retire and ski full time.  The company really needed the specialty help, so he worked out a deal, where he \"works\" about half a year and takes the ski season off, while making close to full annual salary.\n\nI knew another senior+ opportunity that had to fly out and work in New Zealand regularly, weeks at a time.\n\nAnother option is you can create your own consulting company, then work with \"remote\" clients wherever you want.  Since it's your company, you have to deal with all the taxes and legal risks while working \"remote\" in another country.; You only become a tax resident in another country after living for 6 months usually, so as long as your position is fully remote, most likely no one will bat an eye if you leave the country for up to 6 months a year. \n\nAnd if you have a B2B contract, then the company would care even less. There are experienced devs that have rates as high as 1000$/day, so you can certainly get USA level salaries while working outside USA, but they're hard to get.; This is some \"just be rich\" shit lmao; Yes, when you get tech skills and experiences that companies need, companies will bend over backwards to accommodate any working status.\n\nExperience people have been working “remote” for long time, long before current remote fad."

The market is pretty shit right now, and just getting in you can bide your time 'till better days.\n\nBe careful looking at industry/area averages. 2 years ago you couldn't find a senior developer unless the offer was something special. Today, it's a lot different.\n\nAdditionally, I wouldn't conflate the job being open for a long time with leverage to ask for more. These jobs stay open for a long time because the offers are bad, and if they needed to close it, you just offer more money.\n\nThat said, I would email them to see if there's room, as you're expectations for the role, given your responsibilities (getting done X,Y,Z) is 80 or 90k. See if there's even room. It can't hurt to ask, as long as your counter is so far off they think you'll leave.; Wouldn’t hurt to ask for a sign on to sweeten the deal; If you can get higher offers, it's low.\n\nIf you can't get other offers, it's high.; take it.; Which city?; It's low. But do you have anything better?; Yes and no.\n\nAn “IT Developer” would probably pull in something like $60k because it’ll likely just be random scripts, some low-no-code stuff, maybe a legacy system maintenance thing, while also balancing the helpdesk phone queue. ; I think is depends on the cost of living where you live. In general the salary seems low. But I would take it, not for the salary, but for the experience. This is only job #1. Work hard and keep learning. Then plan to make a big jump in salary at job #2 or job #3.; Thank you, I appreciate the advice. I have a meeting on Monday with HR to discuss the offer more, they gave me the weekend to think about it and she is going on PTO starting Tuesday, so the whole thing has been kind of rushed. I applied internally Friday and they offered me the job within 30 minutes. ( my internship ends on the 20th)\n\nI think I’ll just ask if there’s room like you mentioned, since my expectations for the position given the responsibilities are closer to 80.\n\nInitially when they asked me for my expectations in the application I gave a generic response like “I would be comfortable accepting a market average entry level salary commensurate to the skills and responsibilities required for this role”; Do you think it would be better to come with a number in mind or see if they have a typical number for a sign on bonus? I have no idea what kind of number that would be.; Just kinda mind boggling how i was making more not having to think or barely do anything and just put a new roll of paper on a machine every 10 minutes while I listened to audiobooks and watched YouTube. (In fact I made about 80k, since I worked more hours because I could do my homework at work and the work was really easy)\n\nNow I’m going to school and working hard to learn as much as possible, and really spend every minute of my internship trying to solve problems and build stuff.\n\nI just would have assumed that being a developer is more financially valuable to a company and requiring a higher skillset than a machine operator; It’s in wisconsin; Better would be going back to my previous job for the same pay with less hours and more days off that requires barely any effort or skill because I can study and listen to audiobooks. Also at my previous job I get 4 30 minute breaks a day, more vacation and have more time to do personal projects\n\nIf I went back I could study and learn new skills to find a better job; I’m thinking of just trying to get 70k, I think I would be content with that. What do you think?; It developer is the internship, the position is ETL developer, it’s like 90% programming. I barely use any no code stuff.\n\nAnd it’s not  an it help desk, I’m pushing code to production; with your resume I think 60k is a lot... Lucky to have a job.; In the long run you will make more. If you can make it work now, you will be fine and not even think about this offer or job anymore.; Problem is it’s a different field and doesn’t directly advance my career in computer science other than giving me more time to study; Well, first lesson in how it doesn’t pay to stay. What I mean is, you’ll experience bigger salary jumps moving to different employers than you will through internal process. It wasn’t that long ago that employers sought internal interns because they represented a potential hire pool that could be convinced to start lower than an external candidate.\n\nKind of like, start them early and shelter them from external information about their careers, give them some praise and a FTE role that is sub market and they might just take it out of ease and desperation. ; You’re right, thank you for your comment and advice. I think rather than leave a bad impression that I’m ungrateful or entitled I’ll just accept it and maybe ask for a raise at a performance review"

Since employers consider higher grades a benefit for applicant and university rating depends on graduate employment statistics, there is slow creep up of awarded grades. And that is certainly not because we were smarter than the previous generation or that the current generation is smarter than people who graduated a decade ago.  \nEven the top institutions are not immune to this, though, some do keep the standards up.; You’re saying it like an EE degree is a walk in the park.\n\nUnless you actually like EE, EE is going to be hard as heck to get through. \n\nI studied EE and loved it. I found it easy because it naturally clicked for me. \n\nMy classmates were forced into via parents and they all dropped out. Every single one. And these aren’t duds either, they were very smart people just not built for the rigour of an EE degree. \n\nSo please, don’t go swinging around your EE nonsense as if anyone with two brain cells can get an EE degree. \n\nFor what it’s worth I also have a CS degree too and I worked half as hard as I did for my EE degree. I couldn’t understand what I was to do with all my free time in CS, that wasn’t a problem in EE because I’d be at the labs all night.; While there are lots of dweebs in cs, there’s also a subset of incredibly intelligent people.

The only thing you can do is to set yourself apart by comitting to a specific role. For example, backend, infra, data eng, or ML.

Especially if they PIP you. \n\nSo at this point, I would ignore money and name recognition and just pick the company that can provide the most stability.; I appreciate the \"musical chairs\". I call it \"Where were you when the music stopped\".; If I were you, I'd go with the second, since it has two things going for it: highest pay and a nice stack. I'd not touch Drupal with a 10 foot pole and small startups are the pinnacle of instability.; whats the name of the third if you dont mind me asking? it matters imo; Where did you find these jobs?; In these times, I would focus on stability and what will look best on a resume. It seems you think stability of all three are similar. So what looks best on a resume? Name recognition certainly plays a part, but I don’t think it’s as simple as picking the most widely known brand name. The second job sounds like a more sophisticated tech stack, and they’re paying you more which means it’s probably a more challenging job. So I suspect that will add more to your resume than doing a more pedestrian job at a well known but second tier tech company.; Seems like React is good for getting offers; If the third would not use sh*t technologies that most of the employers don't care, at least you would put on the resume some recognizable company (I usually glance over experience gained at start-up because it's very hard to evaluate; the cognitive process is much easier when the resume says \"worked for Bloomberg\" or \"worked for Salesforce)\n\nBut the pay is significantly worse and the technology is cr*p. Take offer 2.; The second offer is what I'd pick for the mix of stability between the startup and the well established company, but also the most pay. I think the delta between 2nd and 3rd offer for salaries is enough to take a 'risk' with the 2nd one.; I took a govt job and now I feel safe; Are you able to ask about the companies financials? What’s their burn rate and how much cash do they have to stay afloat and for how long?; One question I have from your post is your thoughts on your last two roles. Were they at big tech, small tech, or startups? How did you feel about working in companies of that size? Did you enjoy working with the tech stack? Have you worked with any of these stacks before? Do you find the work at one prospective company more interesting? Are any of them in a growing field you might like to be in for the next 5-10 years?\n\nLike some other commenters, I'd personally lean towards the better paying startup with the hip tech stack assuming they have a decent runway. But I will say that after starting my career with a couple of roles at early-stage startups, I'm finding that's where basically all of my recruiter interest is as well, at least as far as roles that would be the next level up. Mostly in fields that reflect my past experience in some way. So if you don't like the startup life, well....; Whatever you do, please do not take the Drupal role. I worked with Drupal (7,8,9) the first four years of my career, and it was the biggest mistake of my professional life due to the pigeonholing of working with a technology that is just so, so out of favor at this point.; Stability is the way to go. Congrats and good luck. Any tips on how you found these roles? Also a boot camp grad with 2 YOE.; Always go for the money. That's the only metric that does not lie. Also make sure the tech stack is not outdated. You need to have the highest pay because layoffs are unpredictable. You need to have a cash buffer. Stability is gone.; If you're remote, take all three and see how that goes ; Wait.

   "Top Comments": "I'm a data scientist with a statistics MSc. Your question is a little vague. Can you provide more information about what you know and what classes you are taking?; Check sticky and many past posts, especially on r/datascience.\n\nData science is extremely broad as a discipline and in terms of job responsibilities, so the demands of the job will vary by company and team.\n\nBut I would say (1) applied math / stats, (2) ML algorithms and practice applying them, (3) functioning knowledge of Python and SQL are absolutely the bare minimum to know. Most candidates should work towards a mathematically rigorous graduate degree, experience with academic research, proficiency in programming / computing (for example, Linux, command line, at least intro CS theory), experience with working with big datasets at scale. Most should probably specialize in some kind of problem area or skills such as computer vision, LLMs, operations research, econometrics, something beyond the basics (not everything, just one or two).\n\nTechnical communications skills make a big difference, but are hard to assess in interviews, so for now just get practice interviewing (try your school career services, then internships, then full time). Some business and business analyrics courses would help, too.; Play around with all the model, Perplexity, ChatGPT, Bard, whatever. Figure out what LLMs can do by just playing with it over the course of several months. Then, build a project using an LLM.\n\nData Science is about doing science. Download some data, play with the dataset, and see what you can figure out. To get \"good\" at data science, you need to do this like 50 or 100 times. This is really the meta framework of science: what data are available to you (or technology exists to collect it), what statistical or ML method can you apply to it, and what can you produce or learn? Great science is always the pairing between some new technology which produces a novel data set, paired with the right analysis technique, which produces novel insight.\n\nWorking in industry, my strategy to apply ML is based on these three things:  \n1) Understand the problem, and know what simplifications you can make that still pay off for whatever end user, and pursue those tradeoffs.  \n2) Pushing constantly for greater analysis capability, better models, more compute, et cetera.  \n3) Pushing for access to more data, or integration of existing datasets."

   "Title": "How much of Java EE and legacy code experience is transferrable to Spring? What to focus/study during my first internship?",
   "Top Comments": "I'd say quite a bit. All the JVM profiling and performance analysis type stuff definitely would. Spring has its own ecosystem but being aware of dependencies outside of that can be good as well.; At the core, Java EE is just slapping different annotations on things, especially if you use something like microprofile. It's not 2005 any more. It's definitely less batteries included than modern spring boot, but it's not terrible. Many frameworks use Java EE conventions and interfaces as a base, ook up stuff like quarkus for example.\n\nThat being said, just looking at what's listed, there seems to be a wide spectrum of technologies, indicating there's a higher risk of actual legacy being used - in particular if you see combination of:\n\n- postgres/mysql and oracle or DB2\n- maven/gradle and ant\n- git and svn\n\nThe FE stack seems to be ancient as well, with AngularJS (out of support for a long time), jquery, bootstrap and vaadin, mentions of JSF and ajax.; If you want Spring work, and your internship included Spring work, put it on your resume as a Spring job. Putting the legacy tech will just give recruiters reasons to pass you over as \"not aligned with our requirements.\" You get jobs by looking like the most qualified person.; Java EE and Spring are the same thing. Back in the day, Oracle created J2EE which was for enterprise software with Java web server API. That got renamed to Java EE. For years I had to list both terms on my resume. Then Spring got invented and has Java EE capability.\n\nJust take what paid internship or co-op you can get. You’re still entry level at 0-2 YoE and this sounds like a good opportunity. Nothing helps your job chances at graduation more than degree-related work experience. If this were in non-Java but still CS, I’d still say to do it.\n\nPlus lots of Java work is porting code pre-Spring to Spring and/or AWS or Azure. As in, an entire team I was on. Learning obsoleted Java stuff is fine and good resume building for this reason.; Thank you, looks like even a Java EE intern or job (as long as it's not longer than 1 yr I guess?) would let me learn a lot of transferrable skills into spring; Well, thanks for your answer. I'm a bit more depressed now. Looks like I need to find a better intern or job as soon as possible....; I think you're right that I'm gonna waste a lot of time learning old stack. Sadly, I'm in no position to chiose for now (no cs degree, no real internship or work experience)\n\nI hope in 4 or 8 months things can change, I don't want to stuck to this old stack for more than 1-2 yrs for sure.\n\n😢; Seems weird that they use maven gradle and ant.\n\nBut whatever. Developers get paid because they can learn. Not necessarily because of what they know.; I see where you're coming from, that's the same advice given to me by someone who said so. But then what's the point of java EE internship if all I learn is legacy code and can't put that on my resume to help me land a better job (spring) .and I don't know how much spring I'll be able to touch in my job...ouch...; Thank you, I feel a bit relieved. Let's see what I'll be doing exactly..; >Java EE and Spring are the same thing.\n\nNo.; why? you'll find legacy stacks like this all over the place; From my experience it's close to impossible that all of this stuff is used at once in the same product, so wait until you actually see what you're working with.; It's exceedingly common at large non-tech institutions in the US to maintain old, legacy software like this alongside newer more modern solutions and you are expected to understand how both work as you are often required to integrate the two in order to create the services they're asking for. You could have a 40+ year old cobol process that creates a data file that gets picked up by some quartz powered scheduled process that inserts rows in a database which a modern spring backed micro transforms and pushes up to kafka topics. Depending on how deep an org runs integration testing, you can be working with a really diverse array of frameworks that span the gamut of history.; If you don't do any Spring work in the internship, that would be a reason not to list it as a Spring job and to fall back on any legacy tech you used that continues to be adopted for new Java-based projects. Just understand that employers will be ruthless in screening for candidates with the most relevant experience.\n\nLooking over your list, items that I would not suggest listing under the internship regardless of whether you used them are: SOAP, Ant, jQuery, Vaadin, Subversion, Eclipse, Netbeans, JSF.; Not really...I feel this is really old legacy, at least in Italy people use spring much more; Thank you very much. In the worst case I'll focus on learning how to build things and not these technologies themselves. The logic should be transferrable. In my free time I'll keep learning spring and angular, and write java EE + spring on my resume to fake up a bit. Hope this will do the trick. Thansk; Thanks, let's see how my internship goes...thank you so much!; Older companies can take a long time to update legacy systems, so you will find plenty of companies that still use these"

We have no idea how many of those jobs are real jobs and how many of them are fake jobs in an effort to make a company look like it's doing well. \n\nThis is the same deal like when they measure unemployment based on how many people contact the unemployment office to check in. Most people stop checking in when their benefits run out, even though they are still unemployed and seeking work. So all of a sudden if a lot of people run out of benefits and stop checking in, the illusion then pops up that everybody's working. \n\nI'm not trying to cast doubt or be a Debbie Downer, but just simply saying that I can't always trust when someone says that everything is better than it was last year. If that were the case we would see lots of people getting interviews and landing jobs as opposed to still seem more layoffs happening. \n\nI do believe it's going to get better, but likely we'll be seeing actual growth later this year into next year.; You know it’s good when  Revature is taking applicants ?; I've personally seen the market turn around in the last couple months.  I do think it's on the mend.  But I've also seen data showing there are 3x the number of SWE for every open job.  It's still a knife fight with other candidates to get a job. And it's going to take a while for the market to absorb all the talent that's currently on the market (god forbid we get another round of large layoffs again this winter).; People need to understand there have more tech positions eliminated in non tech companies . My 2 lay off from last year were from non tech company , they cut their entire tech team; I think 2023 was definitely worse based on the number of recruiters reaching out to me.

I'm open to the idea that being situated in a different country, it's bound to have a different culture... but it can easily go the other direction since the executive is Japanese (I'm really really sorry if that came out wrong.

If you can afford the time to take the classes, getting a BA in computer science *while you build projects* is a great path forward. Many places are walled off to you without that piece of paper, but everywhere will be walled off to you if you don't also learn to build. \n\nThe point I am really trying to make is to find a project idea you like and get cracking. Don't make the mistake so many fresh devs make thinking that getting the degree is the first step in the becoming-a-dev process and expect employers to hire them when they understand so many theories of programming, but haven't built a thing outside of school assignments. That might have been the case when the market was white hot, but as you can tell from this subreddit, employers are quite a bit more discerning these days. \n\nIf you keep at your projects, your skills will improve, that alone makes it not a waste of time.

It is as easy or as hard as your sales skills are good or bad. If you don't know the first thing about market research and industry conferences and pitch decks, yeah, very very unlikely anything is going to pan out. \n\n\nThe red flag I'm seeing here is you clearly know nothing about contracts and are essentially volunteering to do free work. Normally sales work on a combination of salary and commission and any long term relationship would have an account manager, so you're looking to land a half mil contract, which is typically a few months of sales work.; Are they a legitimate company? This sounds like a scam to me or at the very least taking advantage of you.I work for an enterprise company that has a sales department and project managers that interact with and sell our products. They go.to trade shows and other industry events to build relationships with clients. While developers sometimes go to trade show to talk about products and that sort of thing, we would never be responsible or expected to sell things to clients.; >I then told them that I would try and help them find a client.\n\nYou don't know anything about the business or the client base, why did you tell them you can get clients?; It sounds like they are using your no experience as an excuse to fill need to recruit more clients.

Plus they have a portfolio of products which they've made in the past. I am guessing an investor is more likely to trust them to build a product rather than a sole developer? \n\nThey told me that if they get long term funding for a project, they would be able to add me to the team.; >s. i would inquire with the prospective employer about what they have in theie sales pipeline, they could be very close.\n\nBy sales pipeline do you mean \" what exact field they specialize in \"? I know what field they specialize in and what kind of software they usually make. I'm seeking out clients who work in that same industry (including closely related industries); Yeah they seem to be a legitimate company. They did not tell me to look for clients, they just told me that they are unable to secure one at the present moment. So then I had to suggested to them that I can help them find one.; you are unlikely to be able to help them find a client. by sales pipeline i mean the prospective clients they are currently engaged with. typically a sales rep or solutions architect of some kind will engage with potential clients to do an initial discovery and formulate a sales pitch. then negotiations, then contract. at any given time a consulting firm is engaged with multiple prospective clients, only a few if any will result in a contract.; not a realistic proposition.; I'm not trying to sound like an asshole, but if an established company can't find a client, why do you think a new grad with no experience will be able to?\n\nWhy did you suggest this?; So you're saying that companies usually will have a long term relationship with prospective clients? Which can go on for years? And the relationship building will increase the chances of a project?\n\nI always thought it was more like a salesman at your door situation. They offer you a product at  your doorstep, and you either buy ot reject. If you reject it, you probably will never see that salesman again.; > if an established company can't find a client, why do you think a new grad with no experience will be able to?\n\nBecause people have different sets of contacts? I know a set of people that the company won't know. Vice versa. \n\nThey are a very small company. Less than 10 people.; yes long term relationships are common for these small consulting firms whenever the initial work was successful. it may be months or years after first contact before the ball even gets rolling, so networking and staying in touch are important for any consulting business. sometimes it can move quickly.\n\nbut i'm saying any new client at all though is not going to be an easy win when you're talking about hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars on even a small contract. there is up front work to be done to convince them to hire your company in the first place and that often involves a weeks-long process where a solutions architect or similar role gathers some info about the clients' needs and puts together a proposal, which is then negotiated on, and that in itself may only kick off a deeper discovery and design phase. hence sales pipeline. the decision to fund any given project depends on the details: time and cost vs. value added. \n\nif the company doesnt have prospective clients they are already engaged with \"in their sales pipeline\", your hopes of being hired in the near future are null."

Some places offer 100% of the compensation agreed upon in the contract whereas some places do other percentages (like 90%). \nAfter your probation period, you get reevaluated to see if you fit in this company or not.

Are the labor laws very strict?; Congratulations!\nwhat's the ML code tests are like?\nDo you need to know about models and such like a DS?; I mean, you don't have to guess.

Coupang is a great employer and they're well known to try and help people they bring over from the US maintain their salary. So, yes, they pay very high compared to the market rate here.\n\nMost MLEs do have master's degrees here. I think that's the case worldwide though, no? Most scientists that I know have PhDs or have master's degrees with a very good publication track record.\n\nThe MLEs that have bachelor's degrees usually don't work on research-y work but closer to model optimization or backend engineering.; That's usually just a formality. Places that don't offer 100% compensation are shunned these days.; As far as I know the US is the weird one when it comes to firing culture. Most states (I think except Montana?) adapt the \"at will employment\" doctrine which allows employers to fire employees for whatever reason, just like how employees are allowed to quit for whatever reason.\n\nI can't speak on behalf of every country but I don't think that's the norm.; Thanks! And yes, that's pretty much what it was. I was given a baseline model, a benchmark dataset, and was tasked to achieve a higher performance than the baseline model's performance when trained on that dataset's training set.\n\nI was free to do whatever I wanted, so I just decided to take the simple approach of using data augmentation techniques. From there I added some custom loss functions after using the validation set to figure out which samples that model was getting wrong or was having a high error rate on.\n\nOn a side note regarding your comment of \"like a DS,\" I personally think that this is also what a MLE does lol. A good MLE, in my opinion, should know how to perform modeling/research and also engineering. Data scientists are the guys who should be working with numbers and statistics. But, again, every company and person has their own definition.; What are you talking about?; Yes it's was weird for me so I asked. \n\nWhere I work MLE create and maintain pipelines for DS, responsible for ML serving and model performance while DS does the research, experiments and support customer questions.; Ah yeah maybe that's also a cultural difference. Here the MLEs you're describing are being referred to as \"MLOps engineers\" more and more these days.\n\nFor the latter I've seen terms like data scientist, research engineer, research scientist, etc.; I think it's something that just depends on the role, team, and company. I'm in the US and my role is very similar to what you describe. I like the way[ this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1cbpt74/difference_between_mle_data_scientist_and_data/l12ux9t/) explains it:\n\n> Generally speaking, both an ML Engineer and a Data Scientist can train an ML model. The difference is that a data scientist will normally bear more of a responsibility in solving the right ML model for the actual business problem at hand, while the ML engineer will bear more of a responsibility in making sure that ML model can be executed so as to be able to meet the demands of the business."

Some (very rare) start-ups do have highly performant teams but they are rarely looking for juniors.   \nYou need to be able to learn good practices and trying to figure out how things should be done from a single senior with no existing infrastructure in place is bound to leave holes in your understanding.   \n  \nYour work will have higher impact but frequently you will be trying to reinvent the wheel which is hugely frustrating as a junior. Your goal as an ambitious junior is to build a repository of patterns and architectures, and start-up, especially where mostly everyone is also junior level, is not the right place. \n\nIt can be a good place to learn about product development as you will be iterating and trying out a lot of ideas, wear many hats and your suggestions will be heard. \n\nIn general, my opinion is that start-ups initially should not be hiring juniors, in a race against time there is just no time or resources to build them up.

There isn't much that any intern can do within 3-4 days of onboarding.; Name and shame; Everybody is saying, \"What did you do?\" but nah, it's not OP's fault. This is a bullshit company that doesn't want interns, they want underpaid rockstars. Interns are there to learn. If you were fired in the first week, they didn't give you a chance to learn. It's not anything exceptional the OP did because it wasn't just them. Another intern was also fired, and the company had warned in advance that something like that would happen by talking about a probationary period.\n\nIt sounds like they hired more interns than they wanted and planned in advance to weed out the lower performers.; can you contact the other offers and ask if they're still open?; Probs ran outta money for both of u. Anyone who thinks it's because u weren't good enough is watching too much anime or still in grade school; Don’t take it too harsh. If they fired you for not contributing in your first week, they’re a shit company to work for.\n\nI’m a lead and between initial onboarding and setting up my environment, it takes me three days to even get started looking at a codebase and a couple months before I have contributed something meaningful.; The company realized they couldn't afford interns; maybe their grants got denied or they just realized they needed the cash. Not your fault.; Lesson learned, you're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you.\n\nContact the prior ones and see if they still have availability.; How did you bring down prod?; did you step on the CEO’s small dog?; That’s some crazy bullshit. Clearly they were not interested in education and experience. They wanted someone who knew it all the moment they walked in. I do ALOT of training with new hires. We just brought on two brand new FT devs who can’t tell the front end from the backend. I’m sure they were hired cheap but I’m happy to work with them.; There should have been training and if you broke rules you should have been warned. Tell your school what happenned; Tell us what happened. Please.; I think they just wanted to rescind an offer or something; What the hell did you do?; I had a similar experience as an intern where they terminated the project due to a business change :/; They must be running out of money or forgot you were even coming, I think most companies with any decency would keep them at this point even if there is no real need, interns have to do some major fup to get fired.; At least you started yours!\n\nMy first internship never materialized because I stupidly let the ink dry on my offer during the height of COVID lol.\n\nWhen I found out mine was moving to “virtual only” (read: offer rescinded and no longer getting paid - some virtual and job search related activities as a replacement).\n\nSometimes there’s nothing you could’ve done to prevent shit going south. Take a day to feel the feelings and process the disappointment, then keep it pushing:\n\n-if you’re reallllly desperate, you can try contacting back the people you declined and explain the situation. If they’ve filled the role, they can confirm if nothing else.\n-Reach out to your network to try and find other places hiring or offering an internship. I got my replacement FT job because a friend’s husband ran the desk and put a word in. Even if you can’t find an internship, steady employment looks good. Even better if it’s in your field or adjacent. Failing that, find something customer-service oriented. Nobody wants a nerd who locks themself in a room and refuses to talk to people unless they’re Really Good. And with zero YOE, you’re not. Get working on strengthening your (people) networking skills if you don’t already have demonstrable evidence of having them.\n-Consider posting on LinkedIn to see if you know of anyone who can help with a referral or leads. You can leave out the details if you’re not comfortable sharing them with something like “my internship fell through” vs. “I and another guy got fired randomly.” Not a good look if you flame employers because prospects assume you can/will do the same to them.\n-Hit up local “consulting” (read: temp) agencies. It may not be an internship, but if you need $$$ yesterday they may have something for you. Unlikely, but never hurts to get your name out there. They may also be able to offer resume help. Good orgs will help you find the right fit or refer you to someone who can.\n-You can always utilize your college’s job aid supports to see if they can help, too. ETA: someone else said report the behavior to the institution. Hard agree with this. Let them know your experience was poor in hopes this doesn’t happen to someone else/employer learns a lesson and gets their cheap labor taken away.\n\nThe important thing is to do SOMETHING, and don’t let your summer go to waste. Even if it doesn’t end up how you planned, take heart—it’s still salvageable, and a lot of bumps in the road are figureoutable when given enough time.; Sounds like management decided to lay people off.\n\nYes, companies keep hiring before deciding to lay people off. Seen people get hired then fired weeks later along with longer term workers. Management has poor control of either it's operations or it's impulses.\n\nReach out to the places you turned down. Say the company let the interns go. It won't hurt."

Obviously I want to find the best way to select the candidate who will be the best match. So : What would you feel is a fair interview?\n\nI am fighting against stressful interview questions. The person who wins \"quick thinking under pressure\" may not be good at the real job: \"deep thinking in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere\". Also they would probably be happier driving getaway cars or something.\n\nTalking about experience & passions, personal tech projects, their CTF team, where they're at and where they want to go, etc. you can learn a lot about a candidate, but this is also also vulnerable to bias and bullshitting. You have brilliant candidates who undersell themselves, and bullshitters who claim to be amazing at and super interested in whatever we want. => I think some actual \"testing\" is necessary.\n\nWe sometimes organize a non-virtual CTF where you can win some swag. Obviously if someone who participated, later applies for a job, we can be sure about their skills.

This is just an arms race, and a truly brilliant candidate would be too busy having fund doing actual cool stuff and would now lose at l33tc0de.\n* What I'm currently doing is brainstorm with the candidate about real problems I am currently trying to solve.

   "Title": "Enlisting into the military with a CS degree?",
   "Top Comments": "I spent 7 years as an Army Infantry Sergeant with 2x deployments including Aceh Province, Indonesia and the triangle area of Jordan/Syria/Iraq. Just got out less than 4 years ago. \n\nMilitary fucking sucks, and if you go in as an enlisted with a CS degree, I will personally find you and slap you myself. \n\nMilitary life is 1 million times different than civilian life. \n\nMilitary life: \n\nThere's no sick days\n\nyou get off for the day when you're told you can get off\n\nyou can be woken up at any time for no reason at all\n\nYour weekends can disappear in an instant because a dumbass in your company got a DUI \n\nThere's no quitting if you don't like what you do \n\nDeployments for 9 months - 1 year away from family \n\nYour superiors can and will yell in your face and you can't do a single thing about it, they also have the ability to ruin your career administratively. \n\nYou wanna go 75 miles outside base? Sorry, need to get it approved by your chain of command \n\nEven as an officer, you're just a PowerPoint making pencil pusher and coffee runner bitch boy until you hit Captain, 6 years later. And yes, the battalion commander(05) will yell behind close doors and throw chairs across the room. \n\nIf you're enlisted, your sergeants/platoon sergeants will just get right in your face and yell like there's no tomorrow if you do something wrong, and then have you do physical activity. \n\nYoure also subject to random room inspections at any time. \n\nAnd the worst part? You're not going to be an enlisted or officer doing \"coding\" work. \n\nAll that stuff is done by civilian contractors who work for the D.O.D. \n\nIf you wanna work on military-equipment go to Lockheed, Northrup, or a related company.\n\nMy point is, you'd be a straight dumbass to have a CS degree and go enlisted and give up all your freedom and earning potential. You will eventually get a CS job, but the moment you sign that military contract....you're not a person, you're government property and they've got your ass for the next 4-6 years and there's nothing you can do about it unless you die or get injured bad enough to be discharged. \n\nAlso, peacetime military is stupid as fuck compared to wartime military. 2 completely different types of military culture depending on if we're in peacetime or actively at war.; Why enlist? You have a degree. That qualifies you to apply for OCS.; I have about 10 years of (IMHO) relevant experience and will chime in here with details but the TL;DR is I do not recommend joining the military (I assume you mean US military).\n\nI worked alongside active US military personnel for 10+ years both overseas and domestic, and across the four major branches. Every one of them who made a career out of it (both officer and enlisted) have told me they wouldn't have joined if given a second chance and have strongly discouraged their children from joining.\n\nI should add that most of them are from the more \"office/professional\" environment of the military. They haven't seen much combat, if any, but they've still been treated terribly. I work with one of them and he's been bed-ridden awaiting back surgery at 38 years old due to re-aggravating an injury from the Navy. Guy was literally months from retirement and now it's likely he'll never run again.\n\nTwo other officers I know of can barely walk due to multiple knee surgeries after serious injuries from airborne training. Another one was a marine who died during a training exercise.\n\nI think I worked with over 100 USAF enlisted personnel and talked to them daily. Every one of them was either in their first term counting down the days to leave and never return or 15+ years in counting down the days to retire and never return. They showed me their on-base housing and it was covered in black mold and puddles at the front door from the rain. Guess what type of work environment I got to enjoy being around those people...\n\nKeep in mind you would be on hook for likely 4 years minimum active duty. I know the job market is rough now but it won't be like this forever. You may get orders to some absolute shit hole of a base and have to live in an area with nothing to offer while surrounding by coworkers who are raging alcoholics. And while, I never served, I worked alongside them in every sense of the word. I had a two-year contract and god those two years seemed like an eternity.\n\nHowever, if you are determined to join the military, please strongly consider the Space Force or Air Force. You would have a much higher chance to utilize your degree and work on things that will transfer to the civilian world.; I mean if you’re keen on the military, you can apply to the NSA and get into one of their 3 year development programs and gain actual skills that will translate to any other tech job.; I was a cybersecurity officer. I work in big tech now, and it feels like I just waited around six years to get to this point. It wasn’t a super enjoyable six years, and literally all of my military buddies are counting down to their separation dates \n\nYou have other options. Don’t pursue military, I say; Enlisting as a person with a college degree is a fucking stupid decision even if you have no moral qualms at all about joining the military; Join as an officer you twat; It takes much more effort to get started in tech industry, CS degree is simply a starting point.\n\nYou have to learn how to write tech resumes, reformat and revise countless resumes, until you start getting recruiter attention.  \n\nThen you have to go through the tech interview gauntlet, internships, entry level jobs, etc.\n\nYou also have to do tons of personal projects, develop apps that actually solve real world problems, etc.  So you have something to show for delivering impact, during behavioral interview sessions.\n\nThe first tech job can take months, sometimes years, to get through and get offers.  There are no shortcuts.; I’m not in the military, but just wanted to throw out there, the stability may be nice but you are committing at least 4 years of your life in exchange for that and shit pay. Thats a big commitment for something that isn’t going to do much for your career when you get out outside of maybe having security clearance.; It’s called a crisis. You’re going through a career crisis. Everyone does, it’s ok.\n\nAnyway relax and don’t enlist in the fucking military lmao. You’ll make more money with better hours working as a CS Tutor or doing basic office work in some other role rather than whatever bullshit you’ll do there. “Enlist as a backup” is for people with minimum wage jobs and low career prospects, not Degrees in Computer Science.  If you want to work in defense, that’s great. Do it for a defense contractor or a 3 Letter Agency, not the army itself.; You graduated 5 months ago but you’re 27? What did you do in that time between graduating high school and graduating college (besides attending college)?\n\nYou seem pretty dead set on joining, which I also think is a mistake as a former officer of 10 years, but that’s your prerogative. I would still say do everything possible to be an officer over enlisted unless there’s an MOS you REALLY want and can get a contract for before signing your name on the dotted line. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE BELIEVE ANYTHING THE RECRUITERS TELL YOU ABOUT SELECTING AN MOS LATER ON AFTER BOOT CAMP. At that point the only guarantee you’ll have is that you’ll be a member of whichever branch you join, everything else is up to the “needs of the Air Force/Army/Marines/Navy”.; I was Navy and Army enlisted. Plenty else has already been said about military life. But what I ha ent seen is any say there is a difference between enlisting and commissioning as an officer. You need a degree to be an office and as such your a leader with more responsibility and can actually be \"fired\". When your enlisted you have no freedoms and technically make no decisions in a manner of speaking. Quality of life for officers is much better. If your gonna go in I'd say look into the Air force or Space force as an officer. Those two branches have probably the highest level of tech and best use of your degree.; US right? Eh go through OCS and get paid more while doing less work. Enlisted to E-3 is a sucker play. Unless you aren't a US citizen since only citizens can be officers.\n\nNo guarantee you get to use your degree. Even officer pay is less than starting CS pay. You give up your freedom and get subject to the UCMJ instead.\n\nIt's a risky move but could pan out. I agree with comment about going Air Force.\n\nGet married now. Will be harder later. You get paid more if you're deployed while married and significant others can't live on base unless you're legally married to them. It's kind of a joke how many ROTC students get engaged their senior year at the age of 21/22. Actually, it's not a joke at all.; Dude join the space force. Not even kidding. They heavily value cs degrees. I’m former army, not space force however I know quite a bit about their branch. \n\nYou’ll have a kickass career.; If you’re going to join don’t enlist. It sounds like you have at least a bachelors so if that’s the case apply for OCS and go through that and join as an officer. From what I understand you go through OCS then if you pass they’ll say what your assignment would be but I’m pretty sure you can turn it down. \n\nOther option I’d look into is the federal government. Kessel Run is a software factory owned by the AF so maybe look into that. \n\nThe question you actually need to ask yourself is if you are ok doing something you don’t believe in and whether you are fine with someone telling you what to do. The US military is not the military of old from what I understand. For example, if you think the US shouldn’t support foreign wars then you’re out of luck. The official position of the US is to support Israel and Ukraine so I really hope you’re ok with that.; Did 5 years active duty in the Marine Corps as enlisted after high school before getting my CS BS. \n  \nI loved it, but it really isn't worth the time given that you have a degree. I was taking home $1,500 / month working long ass hours. It's great when you're straight out of high-school but not worth the time otherwise.; if you do join the military you need to join as an officer. You are actually retarded if you join as enlisted while having a bachelors degree. Please do not go enlisted. I think i read something about you not being able to go in as an officer for what ever reason, if this is the case then work some warehouse job while upping your CS skills. Atleast in this case you'll be making more money than you would as an enlisted (unless youre married (then you'd get BAH which would add a noticeble bump to your pay)). Once again do not join the military if you can't go officer with your degree.; Okay, my experience is in a different career field (aviation), so YMMV.\n\nIf you’re joining the military just because you want a job right now, you may seriously regret it if the market picks up and now you’re stuck in the military for a couple more years making way less than your peers. You might also get stuck doing a job you didn’t want. The military does what they want, even if you don’t like it. It could seriously backfire.\n\nYou could consider joining the National Guard instead just so you can avoid the commitment if a better opportunity comes up in the civilian world. My husband is a pilot, and he started in the air national guard and never actually got to be a pilot in the military like he planned. When the civilian world became a better option, he just stopped working for the national guard. We were even able to move out of state. But he still had aircraft maintenance experience from the military which helped him a lot in his career.\n\nThe problem with the national guard is a job isn’t guaranteed. My husband finished basic and then was unemployed for almost 2 years despite his best efforts, so he still ended up working minimum wage retail. And mind you, he was a top candidate, but unfortunately the military often assigns jobs based on seniority or other factors.\n\nI know some people say you can always switch to national guard after enlisting, but I don’t know how hard that is. That is something you could look into.\n\nBUT, even though joining the military didn’t end up making my husband a pilot like he’d hoped, he still has no regrets because the military benefits are awesome (VA home loans, reduced interest rates on private loans, discounts, etc.). Also, some employers value military experience on a resume (think any industry in defense, aerospace, etc.). His military experience did help him get into flight school,  reduced our private student loan interest rates (saving us $1000 per month!), got him his first piloting job, bought us our first house, and even got him a hefty pay bump. He’s now 25 and makes $120k and is in line to be making $160k starting next year. All because the military boosted his civilian career.\n\nTldr: there’s a chance the military might not get you to where you want, but there’s also a chance you’ll still consider it worth it because of all the other benefits.\n\nAlso Air National Guard is cush AF.; Why not work as a DOD civilian?\n\nIt’s a livable wage, job security (typically), and experience if you seek it. People complain about old technologies, but I worked with all modern cloud tech stacks. \n\nIt’s only unideal in that bases are often far away from everything, classified spaces can be dull, and — depending on where you are — the culture can be insular and old-fashioned. \n\nI just left. I had to tolerate the drawbacks, but I worked really hard and got great experience. And on the other side, I got a decent amount of opportunities in this tough market.; I had the same idea as you shortly after I finished my Master’s in CS. It’s a bad idea. Even with a CS degree, you are not guaranteed to work in cyber if you become an officer. And enlisted pays so poorly that it’s not worth it if you already have a degree. \n\nIf you want to work in public service, you can get a job for the federal government or for a local government. Federal government jobs are very competitive but there is a serious labor shortage for local government jobs and it is very easy to get one."

   "Top Comments": "Yes it's *possible* to find SWE new grad work in NYC.\n\nIs it likely? Depends.\n\nMost new grads don't have the ability to be picky. Declaring that you're only willing to work for companies that are remote or in NYC drastically restricts your job search. When you're limiting yourself to that small subset of jobs, you're handicapping yourself.\n\nIf you have 3+ years of experience, that's not so bad. You can generally be picky about things like location. As a new grad, that's not normally the case.\n\nPre-pandemic, after graduation moving to wherever you could get a job was extremely common. Most people didn't get their pick of the litter, they went where they could get a job.\n\nMy story, despite being a decade earlier, isn't so different from yours... I started my career in the Midwest. It was a decently sized city, so wasn't terrible, but I always knew I wanted to move to the east coast eventually. I stayed at that company, learned as much as I could, made some life long friends, and after 3.5 years I joined a company on the east coast and made the move.

NYC is a fun town, but building it up as the only thing that will make you happy is setting yourself up for disappointment.\n\nAnd to answer your question - new grads are getting jobs there. More than zero of them. Whether you can be one of them can only be discovered by applying and interviewing.; Thank you. I can always stay in Midwest and work. I just honestly am not happy here and my mental health really is suffering, and I can’t explain it but I feel so much more happy and alive in NYC. I think it would be much better for me emotionally and mentally (maybe not financially). I hope I can find something there. Thank you; Yes, I’m from Midwest. I can’t explain it I just feel trapped here. NYC I feel so alive, the huge range of cultures and people I love it.; No in Kansas City :/; I can’t blame you tbh. City life is full of fun and adventures compared to the Midwest. Once you get used to it, you can’t ever really go back.; Ha! It can get much worse than Kansas City in the Midwest. You lucked out tbh; Ya it’s tough. I’m not saying the Midwest is bad or anything, it’s just not for me and I don’t feel a spark of life like I do out here.; I’m not saying it’s bad. But I’ve been here my whole life since I was a child, and I’m not happy here. I don’t feel free, city like NYC is so diverse full of different people. I need that to feel alive.; If you ever do decide to leave, then send me over to be a replacement for you :); I hope you make it to NYC. Good luck.; I’m from KC and moved to NYC a few years ago. I also felt a draw to the diversity and energy here, so I wish you all the best in your search.

There are a lot of crud applications exist, and developers need to work on them.\n \nFind a few positions that look interesting, read requirements. Determine gaps between your current skills and requirements. Do not aim for matching 100% of requirements, 70-80 percent is more than enough usually. If the gap seems too wide, look for positions closer to your current skills, and do the same. Try to find the next position that will positively affect your career, be it getting new skills, widening experience, smart colleagues you can learn from or something else. It could be an iterative process over the years. \n\nStart applying to positions and interviewing right away. This will make it clearer for you where are the places you have to concentrate on. if you can get interview invitations, but fail interviews, more effective will be work on problem solving/widening and deepening existing skills, than learning AWS to improve resume. If you can't get invitations, no matter how many positions you apply, your resume is probably worth improving.

I will also familiarise with database concepts and Maybe some known frameworks like Django and FastAPI\n\nThank you for the advice; You cleared my confusion whether to prioritise AWS Certification. It seems, instead of worrying too much, I should instead start applying immediately by customising resumes according to job application which obviously matches my skills.\n\nThanks this helped me.; Given the above requirements, Yes I can definitely build all that, except the testing part.

   "Top Comments": "I dont even think structuring it like “I will take this this and this in these years” really matters. No one really reads someone CV that deep. Take stats and maths for your own future life easement. Never look at courses as this would open doors because none of them actually will, you will just learn a concept. Put yourself out for the university societies especially the ones are related to tech and engineering. The rest, pick whatever tickles your pickle man its your life in the end. There isnt a master strategy; If you want to maximise your chances I'd say pick a path first. MLE, Robotics and Quant Research are completely different fields, even if some of the stuff overlaps. They are all very competitive to get into. In the end what really matters are projects and applied skills. It's much easier to build stuff when you are not distracted by having to learn irrelevant courses.  \nNone of the universities at undergrad really prepare you enough for any of the three jobs you mentioned.\n\nFor Quant especially you should be focusing on research skills. Quants in general are mostly non-entry level positions, and you'd be expected to be already able to do the job (and most accepted interns are able to). It's a very common requirement to be doing PhD to be considered for internship but they do have undergrad interns and that is probably the only way to get into Quant role after undergrad. Getting one from non-target school is incredibly difficult though.\n\nFor MLE intern you'd also be expected to already have relevant projects under your belt. Positions, where you only need to have programming skills are too rare to bank on it. Frankly speaking most of the math required for MLE is not particularly advanced and you pick up on your own by reading specialised books or a course. The only exception is AI research positions but that's not MLE.\n\nFor robotics I have no clue tbf but it will be role specific. Preferably be very strong in one role and have supplementary skills around it.\n\nIf you like electronics but want to focus on the software side I'd really consider embedded systems development.  \nIt's always in demand, easier to get into, much more stable long term, though less glamorous and worse paid than MLE.\n\nThen google roadmaps for that particular path and pick the courses that most closely match that.\n\n1.) Computer science with math. But that is only because you be more prepared for data science/analytics roles and more numerically focused positions. But that is only if you are able to succeed in both. For MLE Software engineering skill, understanding of ML libraries and general CS knowledge is far more useful. A good knowledge of CS will be preferred over average knowledge in CS + average knowledge in math.\n\n3.) Nobody will ever check. Recruiters give at most 60s for each CV. You could write that you enjoy clubbing seals as a hobby and they likely wouldn't notice.; Oh only thing if you are a citizen of the country that you are studying go for military tech.

Database Solution: Any (recommend PostGres)”; The assessment was actually automatic. Everyone who applied got it after a few days and got auto rejected today at 5 PM eastern.; YOOOOO THIS SAME COMPANY DID THIS TOOO ME!!!; I once had a startup (legit, backed by Sequoia) ask me to build an MVP as a take home assignment, complete with backend in AWS or equivalent. I replied with a lengthy description of how I would architect it. They replied something to the effect of “No we want you to build it.”    Hard pass.; That's inexcusable; sorry you had to go through that. And good on you for courageously naming them.\n\nTo confirm, the Current you're referring to is the NYC fintech company?; Lol, I applied to them and got my take home assigned, took one look at it, and said fuck that. I feel like I dodged a bullet now.; I had a technical interview with them a few months ago and got completely ghosted by their recruiter afterwards; Kinda curious what kind of take home assignment takes a week. Would love to have a look if you still have access to the question.; I got this too. Thing wasn’t too difficult but definitely a lot of work.

Stupid shit; This makes me glad I never finished it. I also got the same Current take home assessment (back end banking system). Struggled with it for a couple days and got so frustrated that I just gave up. Seeing your experience validates my decision to be lazy!; Lmao they sent me a take-home assignment as well.

Multiple people in here are saying they got ghosted so I ‘m glad I didn’t waste my time.😂; Fuck that company you guys should leave a bad review on Glassdoor about their shitty interview process. I work for a tech company with 11yoe, when we interview the most we will do is take home app that is incomplete depending on the position we are hiring for, where we expect the candidate to finish the implementation with the appropriate testing. We then go through their solution with the candidate in the next round of interview. If a company ask you to build an app from scratch as a take home, tell them to go fuck themselves. Unfortunately with this market this appears to be a common shady practice. We can only hope this doesn’t last too long and things will start turning around again.; easy, I hear \"take home assessment\" I withdraw my candidacy; I got a few right here - Kleros, Vimcal. \n\nDon’t waste your time; To this day I've never heard anything good about fintech companies ; My rule of thumb: I don’t do take homes unless:\n\n- I can do it in max 4 hours\n- There are mechanics in place to ensure that no other candidate can spend more than 4 hours\n\nI have seen a few companies ask me for a time slot when I want to start on it, then they e-mail me exactly at the start time and give me a hard deadline of a few hours later.\n\nThese I can be OK with, since I know that my time investment is limited and I am not up against desperate candidates who have nothing better to do than to spend a full week on it.\n\nI decline any take homes that cost me more than 4 hours, or where the company doesn’t put a hard deadline in place (without hard deadline my limited time effort will be fruitless since it will be compared against other people’s full week efforts).; Never do take homes unless they pay you for your time; do you have a link to their website? current is a generic name and i cant find a business when i google it.; Awful.\nBut hi!\nLook at the bright side,\nYou can take this assessment strip the company name make it as generic as it seems and append it to your GitHub and projects.\nI heard some do it and it gave them something to talk about in interviews and learned a new technology; I had a similar experience with a startup.

Maternity leave at my company is like half that.; I know someone who did this and was later laid off.; I think you are mixing up sabbatical and unpaid leave. Sabbatical you get paid your salary while taking time off, usually as a reward or if you are in academia. I’m pretty sure no company offers 1 year sabbaticals. The closest thing you could get is if you are a tenured professor at a university, you get 1 year off teaching every 4 years of work. \n\nAlso why the fuck would anyone pay you so you go traveling for a year?; Never heard of a sabbatical that long in the US.\n\nMy current company gives 5 week (paid) sabbaticals after 5 years of tenure.\n\nMy new grad company offerred 3 month (unpaid) sabbaticals, I don't recall if you needed a certain amount of tenure, or how often you were able to do it.\n\nThe other 3 companies I've worked with did not offer sabbaticals at all.\n\nAlso, usually companies will include some sort of verbage that means your job isn't *guaranteed* after your sabbatical. You can usually be fired or laid off during it, just like yo can be fired/laid off while you're out on PTO. They just try not to.; Your definition of sabbatical is more modern.

My company was acquired, and he was laid off along with the rest of us.; Yep I think most companies offer unpaid leave but maybe not for a year. in my current gig, any unpaid leave over 1 month needs to have a reason e.g. for burnout or personal emergencies (medical/family). They won’t guarantee your job for a year if you are doing a masters or for travel/leisure, you will have to quit for that.; I know a fair few people that took unpaid sabbaticals for several months and still had their job when they returned. It's really not that uncommon based on what I've seen.; You have to trust that your company won't find some bullshit reason to fire you afterwards though. My company doesn't allow unpaid sabbaticals, but they're legally required to allow leaves of absence for health reasons (including mental health). However, taking an extended leave beyond a couple weeks will get you on some manager's shit list, and you're almost guaranteed to be put on PIP unless you're a lifer and/or someone with domain knowledge of an integral yet poorly documented part of the business. \n\nIt's so consistent that I've got half a mind to take an extended leave when I decide I want out to force them to fire me so I can collect severance.; I haven't seen anyone get into trouble for taking a sabbatical before, but perhaps that's because I'm European? Now that you mention it, it's usually the ones that took the sabbatical that go into an early retirement or switch fields soon after they get back from their sabbatical, but not at all because they got fired; That answers it, you are European.

A smaller team is not guaranteed to offer more impactful work or help with your anxiety attacks.; I give this advice a lot - \"what will you do with an extra $15k?\"\n\nI recently was presented two offers from the same company with a $10k salary difference, with the lower offer giving significantly more equity. I ended up taking the lower offer, because I know from how I do my budgeting that anything on top of the lower offer goes towards extra savings that aren't really meaningful towards my goals and Doordash.\n\nThat $15k might make a difference for you, it might not, but that's how I'd approach the decision.; You have an offer at a different company that is smaller.  Would I take 15k less a year and lose many benefits to move to a smaller company.\n\nI did something like that.  My very first job was with a start up.  It was really fun, but after a year the company went out of business.  We went a month without paychecks because no one would tell us what was going on and we were stupid.  So my second job, I took a 1 year contract with Citibank.  This was 15 years ago, I went from 42k to 63k at Citibank.  The job was listed as IT Security.  My job was to wait for tickets to come in.  Review the ticket request for Read/Write or whatever db access to x Database then if manager permissions were filled out correctly then I would grant access.  Yeah I hated that job.  Eventually, I rode that contract out and it was absolutely not renewed.  If I was a regular employee, I am sure I would have been fired.\n\nI ended up getting hired by a start up and was employee 13.  I took 50k for this job.  I needed a job, so I couldn't complain.  It was 13k less than my last job, but I was doing everything.  I did sys admin, help desk, software development, DBA administration, developed SSRS and crystal reports, BI work, set up mobile device policy.  I actually like it a lot.  After 5 years, I think I was 65ish plus a 15% bonus which usually came out to 80k.  I left that job and went to a medium sized company for 90k.  Coincidentally, 2 years after I left that start up also went out of business.\n\nIt worked out and if I had to do it over again, I would definitely have still gone to that start up for 13k less.  If I were in your shoes, I'd try that smaller company.  If you are happy at your job and doing great at it, the money will come in some way.  I believe if you hate your job, despite the money you are currently making it'll hurt your career in the long run.; Nivida huh? More than the money loss, 15k a year isn't too much, but the loss of benefits might be significant. You need to think about that. But if that's not too much of an issue, obviously switch. Better for mental health.; I’d say never trust small team’s words… unless you are having anxiety attacks already! Just go there, money is not worth the mental issue.; First: I literally just did this (and lost about $40k per year in the process), mental health should always come before financial gains. \n\nSecond: How did you get into Compiler Engineering? One of the jobs I wanna get into ;(; A smaller company/team likely means you'll have more responsibilities in a lot of cases. They wont have a lot of dedicated roles so you'll be expected to know/learn everything. That's my current issue, our company is only about 30 ppl max thats including non developers, and the devs are expected to know EVERYTHING. It's exausting because it starts to make you wonder what the project managers even do when the devs also have to manage the projects. Last week I spent 29 hours in meetings. No I'm not exaggerating, meetings go on so long I just end up leaving, like when one meeting was over 6 hours and it was coming up on my time to get off, I just left and the meeting kept going for another 4 hours.\n\nWhen are we supposed to work when meetings are hours and hours and hours long daily? Nothing loathes me more than when we are at the end of the meeting and the client says \"can we schedule another one for tomorrow\". As soon as we tell them no our project manager gets mad and tells them we have to do the meeting and when we get mad his response is always \"that's just the nature of the work\". But then they also get mad when tasks aren't done because literally every ticket is marked as a priortiy 1 task and everything is always an emergency. Things that aren't even live in prod yet are an emergency to them.\n\nSorry I ranted on a bit so I'll stop here, but smaller companies aren't guaranteed to be better because you'll likely be unofficial taking on extra roles because they dont have the staff to do them.\n\nNot always the case but it's something to consider.; [removed]; I agree.\n\nI know I can do way more than refactor work, but haven’t received any impactful tasks. It makes me anxious that I’m spending my early career doing basic tasks. Tbh I’ve already considered to kms because of this, since the lack of tasks makes me feel like I’m useless.; My anxiety attacks come from lack of work. I see others getting tasks from everywhere but I get assigned like 1 issue a month. It’s a combination of imposter syndrome and performance anxiety amid layoffs. Moving from writing complex programs in grad school to refactor work sucks…; I call it a small company but it’s mid sized popular company with a small team. I don’t think they’re going out of business anytime soon, but it’s the benefits and money that bothers me.\n\nAlso career direction. I work with hardware teams right now, if I leave this role, I will be purely software. I’m not sure if it can affect my future prospects.; I’m not gonna name the companies but it’s moving from hardware company to software only company.\n\nBut I’m curious if people who made such moves experienced better mental health; I pursued a graduate degree in compilers and parallelism, I interned in a compiler team, took up research paper reading classes. I was very passionate about the field but my current role has killed the passion.; How’s the move? Was it worth settling for less?

I really think you would benefit from coaching or therapy. What do you do in your off time? Do you have hobbies? You’re only young once. Don’t spend a bunch of time working just because you feel like you need something to do.; My general approach is I look at what my team needs to have done, I always have a longer list than I have time for, and I go down the list. Basically you need to be proactive, step back and think 'what is going to help the team a lot if I spend a week on it?' and 'what is going to help the team a lot if I spend a month on it?'.\n\nExplore those ideas. Sometimes pitch them to a trusted senior or manager, always be willing to be turned around by your manager, but generally you should understand after a year what your team's pain points are (and maybe what your customer pain points are). Sometimes just do a simple small project and present it to someone for review (but don't spend weeks on this before someone says it makes sense.) Think about how to fix things, then do that.\n\nWhile you want to learn from what seniors assign and coach you on, you also want to basically go into every job saying 'what makes sense?' And then do that.\n\nYou might also have more fun doing operational work. Responding to incidents and automating things that cost you and your team time is usually going to feel more productive than incremental improvements to compilers or search engines, though YMMV.\n\nAlso, have you shared your concern about lack of work with your seniors or manager and asked them what it would be good to look at? Usually people on your team want you to succeed even if they hate you because it helps them and the team.\n\nA startup might be fun in that you would wear more hats and figure out more. But again, YMMV. Ideally think about the best people you'd like to work with and ask if they have any positions.\n\nFor big tech, try to get over a year on your resume, then move if you need to.; Damn, I feel like everyone who gets into Compiler Engineering has a graduate degree… I guess I better get started lol; Just started the new job so I’ll let you know 😂 but so far I have no regrets. I performed well at my old job and was told they would have me back in a heart beat. If I feel like I wanna go back I will :)\n\nEdit: feel free to DM for more specifics"

   "Top Comments": "sounds like you've been stupid lucky and need to be serious about upskilling in your free time, i'd honestly do the same as what everyone recommends new grads do and hit leetcode + cracking the coding interview so you're ready if you eventually lose your good position; Honestly just try not to stress about it. Most people don’t know what they’re doing.\n\nI’ve been in similar situations lately where I have no idea what’s going on but everyone still asks me questions as if I do. About stuff I’ve never even heard of sometimes.  This may not be the most helpful advice. But what I do in those situations is just make something up. ‘Does x data come from (source I’ve never heard of before)?’ Sure you bet it does\n\nYou may be just someone who knows how to talk, which is totally fine. Chances are, that’s exactly what your boss’s boss/CEO/director are too. Many of them don’t have any real skills that you don’t have; Become as physically intimidating as possible and the nerds will be too afraid to question your success.; [removed]; I had imposter syndrome for 8 years in my career, then I got laid off.  Now I no longer think it's a syndrome. I'm back to reassessing where to go from here.  I know I really need to buckle down and do what the other commenter said and hit up some leetcode and cracking the coding interview if I want to continue my SWE career.  Especially in this market...; I don't have imposter syndrome. \n\n\nI made average grades not because I wasn't capable if making good grades, but rather because I didn't value getting good grades for the sake of good grades and I always had to work a job during school. \n\n\nI've never once doubted my abilities, I was simply never given a fair playing field to demonstrate them until I entered the professional workforce. Now that I'm in the professional workforce, I run circles around all the people who graduated with really high GPAs and I do so working less hours than them. \n\n\nEveryone sleeps on the students who make average grades while working part time jobs, but they're some of the most efficient capable people in the workplace. ; for me it would be easy. The material you should've learned in school is not necessary to solve engineering problems. For example, I do not think I am an imposter of an engineer because I can't do Calc 3, never read Milton, or can't play the trombone. And if I ever needed to do any of those for my job, I'd just learn them. But until then, I don't.; I'd suggest rather than doing leetcode, hit the systems books and implement them in own projects. Far more beneficial for a senior and a path to outperform the peers. Keep the leet code for when (if actually) get laid off. It not only has little use for day to day job but system questions are far more important for someone who would be interviewing for senior level positions. \n\nAlso in technical positions you don't get promoted so fast if you suck. You may get lucky once but not twice. If they liked, you for other factors, say good people skills or nepotism, typical you would pushed into managerial positions.; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

(Not for loyalty to a company, but to do right by your skillset) \nSo many of my friends have used the time off to switch paths and rethink their roles. Unless you love the sde role, there may be other technical roles that require minimal coding where you’d find new technical strengths. And there could be technical knowledge you’ve gained in your role as an sde that would be invaluable in these other roles. \nYou know yourself best tho.

   "Title": "Demotivated and just cancelled the coding assessment at Meta",
   "Top Comments": "Use [neetcode roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap), it'll get you there much quicker. You just have to identify the pattern and have some practice in solving each type of question.\n\nGive yourself like 30 mins or less to solve each question. If you cant solve it or feel lost, go and understand the solution. Make sure you don't spend a long time trying to solve any question, that time is better spent reading and understanding the solution.\n\nI prepared this way for Amazon earlier this year and have been doing great in every technical interview since.; Why did you not just interview at Meta for the practice?; Disliking leetcode is not a controversial opinion, a vast majority of people dislike them for the same reasons. \n\nI like to compare it to standardized tests like the SAT or ACT used for college applications. What gets tested on those tests are only minimally related to what they teach in school, so many people study for the tests exclusively just like leetcode.\n\nIt's what we have to work with until they find better ways to assess applicants, and honestly if you can trade a few months of practicing, even if most ppl dislike it, for a chance at massive pay increase it's a really good trade, assuming you eventually get hired by one of the opportunities.; Any FAANG interview will include these types of problem.\n\nI myself haven't really practiced much after my first few failures years ago. I haven't had time since I was working a full time job in tech and trying to keep up with ever changing tech. Now I am back in college, so the biggest issues for most is time. This is why really smart people tend to be the ones that do well.\n\nYou sound like a smart guy so you may just need more time to prep before you start interviewing.\n\nSome people spend months prepping and memorizing the solutions so you shouldn't be too hard on yourself.; A few things you mentioned, and I would like to address.\n1. You tried a few medium questions and solved some of them. Great, keep practicing. Best practice? Actual interview. Worst case you will not get the offer and will have to wait till the next attempt at most 12 months. That's already your plan, to prepare longer at a slower pace. So there is no downside here, only upside in getting more interview experience. You could also get hired. Meta coding questions are generally simpler than in other FAANG interviews, since you have to solve 2 problems during one interview, so they have to be easier, than in places where you have only one question. It's my experience and it's likely not 100% cases.\n2. Leetcode doesn't make you a better developer. Well, you may not use two pointers in day to day work, but, you are getting better with data structures when leetcoding. I found it helped me in my work on features.\n3. You are concerned regarding Meta layoffs. Fair point. Do you reasonably expect that your current company will not do this? Do you value this more than other things that you get excited about when Meta offered you an interview? This and other things to consider when you get an offer from them. Is it a deal breaker and you never will work for them no matter what? Still there might be a sense in interviewing. \n4. All in all, does it make sense to spend a lot of time on leetcoding and interview preparation at the cost of some mental health, spent time, etc? Depends on the ton of things you value and how you value them. What are your career goals? What are you planning to spend time instead? Will it work better in the end? Who knows?; To make you feel better. I practiced leetcode and did ~300 medium + easy tagged with meta thinking I'm prepared. I got hit with a leetcode hard\n\nLeetcode is the game they play unfortunately.; This is kind of a weird post. First of all, it's not highly controversial to dislike Leetcode, it's basically a circlejerk.\n\nRegarding your Google interview, did you get the offer?\n\nI've also pushed back my Meta interview because Leetcode is boring as shit and I'm lazy, and I know it's all about practice, not winging it. I don't want to put myself in a cooldown period by rushing it. But your (moral? risk-adjusted?) objections to Meta because they laid people off is stupid. You'd get a $500k package at E5, and even more if you're E6, and it's one of the only FAANG companies right now that are really pushing the envelope and taking serious moon-shots. I mean, Microsoft and Apple are fine, but they don't pay as well, and there isn't as much variance and opportunity.; your first mistake was posting on reddit where there's so many leetcode monkeys; Most of our questions aren’t super tricky, honestly. And we care a lot about problem solving skills and communication, as well as translating an idea into code, even if it’s not strictly optimal.\n\nNot doing the interview because of the questions is pretty self-fulfilling in the long run.; For motivation, look on [levels.fyi](http://levels.fyi) to see what a Meta engineer gets paid.\n\nIf someone gave you a test and said if you passed, you'd make a million dollars, would you study for it, regardless of subject matter? I would.\n\nOf all the places that are allowed to give bullshit interviews, it is Meta, because they pay lifechanging money.\n\nIf it is some dinky little startup that pays in lottery tickets, sure it makes sense to limit the effort.; The systems that are used internally at big tech are home grown, because there is such a small market for tools that operate at that scale. So it doesn't make sense for them to interview senior people on the external tools they use. What's left is lowest common denominator coding questions. Senior level knowledge does come in the system design questions, but apparently there is not enough signal in those to rely on them completely. \n\nSo if you want to continue to build your career on industry standard tools you can, but big tech is going to be a hard transition.; Not sure why everyone here thinks that if you don't work for big tech you've failed this career. There are plenty of other companies that pay similarly or a little lower with exciting environments and none of the big tech nonsense or layoffs or competitiveness. My time is precious to me so anything done for work outside of work is still work. And I'd rather be making $200,000 and work a chill job for a chill company than making $300,000 and working at a big tech. The headaches, stress and competitiveness that comes with it is just not worth it to me. I know this is not for everyone but I agree with this person here and I'm just here for the money and maximising money/effort and I've been much more successful financially and in a much much better shape mentally than almost all of my friends who work at big tech and make 50% more.; >Here's a controversial opinion. I highly dislike leetcode, since it doesn't actually make me better at my Job. I'm not learning some new technology or architecture or a way of solving problems. \n\nControversial? Sounds like you just read the description of Leetcode from its wiki. The only controversy I see is... you're late to the party!\n\nHonestly to be in a situation where you can rationalize cancelling a big interview in this job market... sounds like you made the right move.; > I have interviewed once around 2018 at Google but it was whiteboard based, and I did well so I was fairly confident to go through the Meta Interview.\n\nThis makes zero sense. Interviewing once at Google six years ago prepares you for an interview at another company now?\n\n> I highly dislike leetcode, since it doesn't actually make me better at my Job.\n\nGood for you? But this is obviously subjective.\n\n> and the prep felt like I'm putting in unpaid hours at the cost of my mental health to work in a company that fires 10k-20k people on a whim.\n\nSo this entire post is just a cope because you realize you aren't as good as you think you are? LC isn't about, and has never been about day-to-day skills on a development team (even though I _have_ actually used sliding window at my job), it's about having a way to compare highly functioning developers against each other for hiring purposes. You should honestly have realized that by now in your career.; [removed]; Screw LeetCode and just OE. You’ll make the same salary.; I did the same with Meta and Google lol; LC is probably some compiling of data to be used for training in the future. Get everyone's different ways of solving problems and construct some model to predict it based on a prompt.; Is there a reason you don’t target an EE role at Meta? No leetcode and the pay is similar to SWE. ; All of this. I got a phone call with a recruiter and started preparing via LC. Then, I got discouraged by how difficult it is. And in the end, what if I spent all of this time on LC and then didn't get the job? It didn't seem worth it.\n\nI decided to study for the GRE instead so that I can go to grad school. At least with a decent GRE score, I have opportunities. With LC knowledge, I feel I'd walk away having gained little."

   "Top Comments": "Unless you’re especially talented or bring something unique to the company, it’s quite unlikely any large company will modify their standard employment contract for you.

Has anyone ever successfully modified their contract, or know someone who has, to make this section less restrictive?\n  \ndefine \"less restrictive\"?; This is to prevent overemployment. They don't want you working two jobs at once and that is a standard expectation from a full-time job.\n\nI'm guessing most people who are overemployed just hide it and try to make sure the company doesn't find out. If they do find out though, there's a high likelihood you'll be fired.\n\nRealistically, they're not going to care if you, say, make money from running a hot dog stand on the weekends. When they will start to care is if you have a significant commitment to another employer that will meaningfully affect your productivity.; No way in hell they budge on something like that.; > Has anyone ever successfully modified their contract, or know someone who has, to make this section less restrictive?\n\nMy advice here is to always offer two options to your employer. Offer one option flexible on legal and offer one option flexible on money. If they are blocked on legal… you can turn around and negotiate on better money. If they are blocked on money… you can turn around and negotiate on better legal.; Yea thats what I'm assuming, especially in this market. Just figured I'd see if anyone had insight; I run an e-commerce jewelry brand. Pretty small and doesn't take much time to maintain.\n\n  \nBy less restrictive, I mean just modifying it to say that I will only work on Amazon stuff from like 9-5, or like that I am allowed to work on my brand as long as i complete my work. Something like that; Yea I can see companies being against overemployment. That's not my intention so it gives me some hope.\n\nIs firing you the worst thing they can do? Can they go after you for wages you earned at another place?; This is a really great idea.    \n  \nUnfortunatly, money is blocked since I am getting a standardized new grad package that is non-negotiable.\n\nLets hope they are flexible on legal haha; Yeah, I guess I should have added: never seen a new grad get it changed. Only very in-demand talent…; Big companies often have an explicit approval process for side gigs, where they make sure that your side gig won't take up too much of your time and won't create any conflicts of interest with your employer.\n\nThe problem though, is that big companies do a lot of things and so a lot of side gigs could have conflict of interest. If the company is Amazon and your side gig is e-commerce, that certainly sounds like a potential conflict of interest as you could be directly competing with Amazon's e-commerce business.; ehhhhh I have nothing to say besides expect that they say no\n  \naka you can either sign offer and no longer work on your ecommerce anymore, or you can continue with your ecommerce business and decline the offer\n  \nand if you hide (sign offer and secretly work on your ecommerce business anyway), if discovered, I'm not a lawyer but I can foresee a potential lawsuit there due to conflict of interest; >That's not my intention so it gives me some hope.\n\nIf the thing you want to do is minor and not likely to be noticed, this is probably one of those situations where it's better to just do the thing secretly than try to ask permission. Asking for the clause to be removed may immediately raise suspicions that you're trying to engage in overemployment, and might even get your offer revoked.\n\n>Is firing you the worst thing they can do? Can they go after you for wages you earned at another place?\n\nHard to say, that's a question for a lawyer.; Thanks for the info!"

I’ve worked with a couple of them over my career, and it’s fairly SOP that they will attempt to staff new projects before everything is finalized, so if delays happen this almost always affects new hires.\n\nMy guess is if they can’t finalize the deal, your start date will be postponed indefinitely.; Well the bureaucratic situation sounds like they are still panning out the details of the project (SOW). I’m concerned about the entire deal falling through since they refuse to guarantee anything (it might be pushed back an additional week). The least they can do is put me on payroll for the time being since I came out here on my own dime; And yea, I’m starting to apply again. Lmao, can’t trust no one; You should ask r/LegalAdvice to see what your options are. Also, I am not a lawyer, but ask them if \"detrimental reliance\" is something you can argue if the job falls through, since you did relocate for this job. (\"Detrimental reliance\" is the idea that someone promised you something in writing, you both agreed upon it, and then you suffered financial harm because that party did not follow through with the agreement.)\n\nIt's tough to argue detrimental reliance if your employer is operating in an at-will state (which is the case 99% of the time), but because you _did_ move to a new area under the assumption you would start a new job, it _could_ be something you can legally fight.\n\nNow, if you had applied for a job that was down the street from where you originally lived, then you'd probably have a hell of a time fighting a rescinded offer in court.

But that depends on the organization and you. \n\nYou should also consider that their is nothing wrong with coding in your free time as a hobby. If you want to make things, I think it’s most rewarding making the things you personally want to see exist.; I have and do work with programmers. Their jobs are high stress and pressure. In most environments that aren't given the time to create the code as clean as they want.  And in a number of places the devs are not give the time to create the unit tests they need to bake into their coding. Plus, in many cases, you will need to program in languages you aren't that familiar with at times so you may end up being forced to produce half assed coding that way...as long as it works.  \n  \nDoing some coding on your own compared to doing it for a living are two very different worlds like you have sort of mentioned.

I burnt out at some point on manager position and got an offer for senior dev role with same compensation. Sounds good? Someone gives you a task and you work on it without care in the world. Turns out I can't really focus on trivial problems anymore, my motivation was 0 when I got my first task, which was basically copy paste with some aditional BL, and I realized that as much I try I can't keep quiet when I get some dumb shit to do which was the point that I don't get caught up trying to solve everything."

I was in a similar position on my first job as a new grad. I realized I was feeling this way not because I was dumb but because of a lack of knowledge of the proprietary tech and business knowledge. There was no documentation and no amount of googling could help. I just accepted as a fact that I NEED help from seniors and NEED to ask questions even if I think I am a bother because in places like this, there is no way around it.

If they don't like your profile, they just don't bother responding and ghost you.\n\nAs for where to find job postings, I agree LinkedIn is trash for finding job postings, but it's pretty good for finding *companies*. That's how I approach job searching. I look for companies first. LinkedIn has a company search tool that lets you filter down by size, industry, location, etc.\n\nI also use Google to find companies. Searching things like \"Best companies in \\[industry\\]\", \"Up and coming companies in \\[city\\]\", \"Companies with the best WLB\", etc. There's pages and pages and pages of \"Best \\[thing\\] in \\[year\\]\" lists.\n\nOnce I've found companies, I go to their website to get the full picture of what they're hiring for. Many times I'll only see 1 role that I'm over/under qualified for on LinkedIn, but on their website there ends up being a bunch of roles that are a perfect fit. Sure, sometimes they aren't hiring at all, but when I come across that I just make a note to revisit that company in a week. A company hiring 0 SWE's today could be hiring 20 tomorrow. I've experienced that many times.\n\nI've never run out of jobs to apply to with this approach, it's always served me very well.; Recruiters are looking to build a pool of software tech connections, this makes their jobs easier for a notification blast. I've stopped accepting connections for run of the mill recruiters - helps avoid mass notifications and spammers.; Strangely enough I do also find companies to apply for using google. Such as \"top defense contractors on the west coast\" or so forth. It has served me well. \n\nJust a shame that job boards, (that are intended to help you not need to do that), are worthless and filled with scams. \n\nAnd it also just really is frustrating that I'm considered \"mid or low level\" because I don't have the coveted five or more years experience, even though I could more than likely fill a senior level role given how well I know I can code, how easily I am able to pass any leetcode test, and my online portfolio which showcases high quality code of mine.\n\nI find it odd that I have been told that I didn't move on to next rounds after passing technical assessments for a few interviews I've done. Either they have too many candidates that pass the technical assessments (which I doubt) or they realize I'm overqualified yet won't hire me for senior level roles."

   "Top Comments": "I was in one years ago and it was like being in a cult.  \nEventually what happens is entitlement springs up. Some people naturally produce more/better than others.   \n  \nSome put more time into it. I say it was like a cult because people lived and breathed there. Which lead to people working 16-18 hours a day. Sleeping and waking up to do more work. And if you treated it like 9-5, you'd missed out on a lot of things that happened at night. And those grudges form because some people felt more entitled because they put in more work.   \n  \nIt was never agreed upon what was equitable.; Are you saying like a cooperative for a company's structure? Like employees have a shared ownership in the company?\n\n  \nOr a co-op like a long term internship?; Naively, I would think for a couple of reasons. \n\nFirst, I think it's easier for companies to secure large amounts of funding through venture capital or the stock market. Worker-owned co-ops don't have these sources of cash without giving up a significant share of ownership to outside investors. Tech companies generally have high upfront costs in R&D (including paying workers), so adequate funding is critical for startups to succeed.\n\nSecond, I'm not sure worker-owned co-ops scale organizationally. As I understand it, decision-making is more decentralized. Major business decisions happen at a slower pace, since everyone needs to vote on them. In a market as dynamic as tech, speed is critical, and worker-owned companies are more likely to get their lunches eaten.

Because cooperatives suffer from having bad incentives and that makes them uncompetitive with traditional firms. You aren't going to find a large group of people that can be equally motivated and be able to maintain the discipline required to keep the business going. People will quickly start fighting about who's doing less or more work and how it's not fair. High performers are incentivized to leave and low performers are incentivized to parasitize the business until it eventually fails, but not before the founders have lost all of their money. \n\nIt's also very hard to coordinate more than a few people and get them on the same page. This is why hierarchies form time and time again. Most business can only do a few things well at a time, if people have opposing views about where to take the company, there is going to be gridlock. Your customers aren't going to appreciate this.; I don't usually post on Reddit, but this is one extremely specific topic area I happen to know a lot about! \n\nEverything you're looking for is in this article. I know there's a paywall, but feel free to use sci-hub to get past it. [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0896920519870577?journalCode=crsb](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0896920519870577?journalCode=crsb) \n\nHere's two quotes that I think get to your question:\n\n\"In many ways, the success of (platform cooperativism) depends on new forms of ethical consumption in which users and consumers abandon the products and services offered by corporate giants and instead opt to support co-operative businesses as consumer members – Fairmondo instead of Amazon, Resonate instead of Spotify, and People’s Ride instead of Uber. While platform cooperativism offers a much-needed alternative to the corporate sharing economy, it also raises questions about what it means if social change is to be facilitated through business enterprises. So, is it possible to challenge digital capitalism through setting up co-operative businesses?\"\n\n\"Greig de Peuter and Nicole Cohen (2015) have suggested that working towards increasing labour autonomy requires (1) creating bottom-up mutual aid infrastructures, (2) developing ideas for worker-centred policies from below and (3) challenging capitalist vocabularies through counter-interpellation. Platform cooperativism certainly has contributed hugely to creating co-operative structures of mutual aid. However, the latter two points thus far seem underdeveloped. As I have argued, platform cooperativism has adopted rather than challenged dominant business language. Likewise, there has been little debate on developing policies that could help strengthen the movement.\"; I would be so into this; I work with and around several web dev coops (UK). Generally they're no bigger than 7 in size, average is probably 5. Their clients mainly do ethical and sustainability work. It really helps if you're friends as well as coworkers. You need to consider how you will split the non-technical side of things e.g marketing, business development, fundraising and so on.; It's crazy how bad this has gotten I remember last year , I was saying don't look for a job in tech at the moment, it's really bad when for people in tech with a lot of experience and I was down voted into the pits hell and was called a gatekeeper  and 2024 it is somehow getting worse; The closest thing I can think of are companies that pay their employees to work on open-source projects. Admittedly it's for selfish reasons but in the end, everyone benefits from their contributions. (Most of the time).; I'd love to be part of a proper tech co-op. On the worker side, a significant portion of comp is in equity and that's been shown to be a good motivator, a co-op is that but _m o r e_.\n\nOthers have mentioned funding, I'll parrot that. I'd love to be part of a co-op with a dozen or so other members, but I certainly don't have $5M handy to carry my part of the fundraising. \n\nYou could get away with a lot less funds if the members _only_ take their pay in equity (a massive driver of cost is human talent costs!) but that's not practical because I have rent to pay.\n\nThere's probably a path to success with standard business loans, but businesses are hard enough to make successful even with the \"easy\" VC model so it would be an added challenge. \n\nOther co-ops in other industries have had success funding through a traditional model and then doing stock buy backs until ~~the business owns itself~~ the only equity is held by employees (I think? I'm not totally sure on the details) and that could be tenable in tech for some businesses.; The only cooperatives that work in tech are those in which no one are getting paid: open source projects run by hobbyists.; It's well known issue [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)  \n  \nAlthough, I don't think it's just tech. It's easier to create shit products in tech because it's not physical and consumers tend to be okay with shitty software.; Cooperatives as in the company structure.; I agree, worker owned cooperatives would run into such problems, but would it make sense to have business owned or membership based cooperatives. Say, ticketmaster is an exploitative monopoly making it worse for users, venues and artists alike. What is stopping a bunch of big venues from coming together and forming a ticketing platform.; Co-ops aren't as rare as it seems like you believe, even in tech. They also don't work quite in the way you seem to think.\n\nCo-ops usually still have things like CEOs and executives. They still have a profit motive. They still negotiate salaries the same way.\n\nIn most ways they appear no different than any other company. They are often QUITE competitive and well known. Winco, Ace Hardware, and REI are all co-ops, for example.\n\nThe main difference is that the shareholders are the employees. And to the person the CEO needs to keep happy is...the employees. Who generally WANT their company to do well, grow, be competitive and stable, etc. It just removes the pressure to engage in shorter term, enshittification strategies since employees tend to value long term stability more than investors.\n\nWhich isn't to say it's magically great. Running companies is hard. Finding good managers and coming up with good direction is hard.\n\nBut it's not like it's a communist commune. It's just a company with a different type of \"investor\" pool.; I agree, worker owned cooperatives would run into such problems, but would it make sense to have business owned or membership based cooperatives. Say, ticketmaster is an exploitative monopoly making it worse for users, venues and artists alike.

Its legality will depend heavily on where your wife and the company are located.\n\n3. Whether it's legal or not, it's insanely abusive and indicates a complete disrespect for workers so she should probably look elsewhere.\n\n4. Horseshit like this is why we need to start unionizing our workplaces now to head shit like this off in the future.; I would anonymously forward the email and report it for refusing to pay for hours worked.; In California, PTO is a form of wage.

You are guaranteed your PTO under most terms would be required to be paid out any PTO balance at the end of your engagement.  But, it really depends on the contract terms.; Sounds illegal. ; That sounds illegal to me, but I have no idea.\n\nMore importantly, I’d start looking elsewhere immediately. 2 weeks vacation is abusive, not to mention taking out that time for timesheet shit.; If your HR is saying that’s an official policy, they are incompetent and going to get their company sued.; Having PTO is not a legal requirement in the USA.

But usually fucking with benefits is a nono. Either fire them or give them a warning. That’s usually the rule of thumb; It may vary state to state, but I had a similar situation a while back. The law in the state I was in said that the employer had to put forth a best effort to get the employees time sheet, and that the burden was on the employer and not the employee to ensure it was submitted.\n\nETA: when I quoted the law and provided a link to it on the state’s website, HR was more than happy to comply.; I'm a business owner in the US. It seems like you might also reside in the US. The Fair Labor Standards Act mandates that employers are ultimately responsible for keeping track of employee time, and that they must compensate their employee for any time worked.\n\nThat said, there are no real federal laws regulating PTO but there are some states that impose their own laws. I would encourage you to look up the law in your state. Also, as a general rule, company policy changes like this that are heavily restrictive or punitive that you did not sign a consent for can be used as evidence to get unemployment even if you quit. I've seen it happen multiple times in the state I reside in: Idaho. Idaho is a notoriously anti-workers rights state too.\n\nLong story short, you definitely have something here, but you need to educate yourself before you make any moves.; What Dogbert-ass sadistic SOB was behind *any* of this?

It's a liability thing.; Don’t bother asking for reasons, they won’t give you a straight answer and it will just waste your time, as well as keep making you anxious. \n\nLet it go. There are a million reasons why you weren’t the first candidate in the running and most of the time it comes down to “the other guy was cheaper”.\n\nIt will be better for your mental health throughout your career if you adopt the mentality of “neither party owes the other shit until there is a written offer”.; Maybe there are people who they liked better. Simple as that; One of the consequences of our current market is that you are always competing others who are equally qualified if not overqualified. I’ve seen this a lot lately, but it’s a good sign that you were in the running even. \n\nThey are window shopping and they considered you!; I had something sorta similar happen to me.\n\nI was interviewing for a startup: it was your typical 5 rounds that covered behavioral and technical white boarding.\n\nI felt good about it and was told I passed it all with flying colors.

Why are you asking me for references at the end of the process? You already gave me an offer. That made my decision super easy and I took the offer from the other company (which paid me more anyway).; Assuming you’re in the US: They are likely saying the rejection reason was someone outscored you. And that’s likely true. However they likely made the hiring decision based not on anything you did, but because you were beat out by someone else. \n\nScore metrics give them a CYA aspect to say that was the reason, when it was likely a close call and they made the decision based on something that candidate had that you didn’t. \n\nIf you want to try again with them, I’d ask about it and express interest in future considerations. Because it’s possible that if you were a final contender here now, you would be again and you might have better luck against a different opponent.; Companies have rescinded signed offers with set start date.\n\nCompanies have let people go just weeks after start date, AFTER people moved cities, etc.\n\nCompanies will only do things in their best interests and business practices.\n\nAlways remember that it's only business, nothing personal.\n\nDeal with all companies accordingly.

Doesn't matter what your qualifications are if they decide they're not hiring.; Fuuuuuck; Name and shame the company; This is exactly what happened.\n\nUnethical, and all the more reasons why reference checks are stupid, and if you have the leverage, not to agree to them until a conditional offer has been made.; Then why not just say they simply chose to go with another candidate, thank op and wish him good luck; This is the smart answer. I wouldn’t have thought of it myself but it makes 100% sense.\n\nI haven’t been asked for references in 5 years. I refused and still got hired. Only time I know referenced were called was when I needed a security clearance.

   "Title": "AWS vs. Azure vs. GCP : advice on cross-certification . Is it worth it? ",
   "Top Comments": "If you claim all but interviewed by a pro in one he will likely fail you because of some dumb ass quirks or best practices. Either way there’s more to worry about but collecting cloud platforms; Just get 1 cert.\n\nIt is very rare for companies to migrate their cloud services from one platform to another because there is often too much complexity involved and it's really expensive. That means if the types of companies you want to work for tend to use AWS (like Rekognition, Polly, Lex, etc), then get an AWS  SAA cert because that company probably won't change their minds for a while and it will be a good investment for you.\n\nAll that said, I recommend you do some basic research to figure out which companies use which platform and why. Then decide on which cert you'd like. For example, some platforms have better AI SaaS offerings than others.; They might help. My interviwers were worried by my lack of public cloud experience. I land a job anyway and was very surprised to learn that to setup any infrastructure I should use their Custom Tool™ and wrapper libraries to access the resource.; Have been working on Azure for 10 yrs. Recently interviewed at a pure AWS company. Every interviewer I spoke to agreed that the skills are transferable and they didn't care that I had never touched the AWS console before. So at a Principal/Enterprise Architect level, it doesn't matter. If you are an administrator, I would reckon they'll look for someone who has practical hands-on skills on one platform rather than multiple ones. So either way, I don't see the point in getting certified on multiple platforms.; For certification quality beats quantity every time.; Depends on what you’re looking for.\n\nAzure: popular with massive enterprises. Kinda clunky but gets the job done. Lots of job opportunities in my experience.\n\nAWS: more popular with startups and medium-sized companies. UI is better but functionality is similar to Azure. Also lots of job opportunities. Maybe higher variance in salaries offered??\n\nGCP: my only experience with GCP was in some SWE labs in college. Seems like a solid cloud platform, but I think it’s customer base is more academia/research oriented and a bit more niche. I don’t see it listed in too many of the job postings that I look at other than to say “experience in a cloud platform (Azure, AWS, GCP) preferred”.\n\nMy recommendation: get really good at one (I’d recommend Azure or AWS), preferably using something like Terraform to deploy cloud infrastructure as code (IaC). If you’re an expert in one of the platforms, your understanding of foundational concepts will transfer over to other cloud platforms with a bit of googling.; Just do AWS.; It sounds like you're highlighting an edge case instead of properly recognizing the value of certifications.\n\n\"Will working out improve my appearance?\"\n\n\"Maybe, but bodybuilders will probably still think your physique is out of proportion, so there's no need to worry about it.\"\n\nThe reality is that cloud certifications are valuable but do not replace real-life experience and hands-on learning with projects, but they do validate a baseline of skill.; Alright Ty for the advice .; I thought most large corporations use AWS; Thanks!; Employers only care what can you do for them not how good you are.; Most massive corporations utilize a multi-cloud approach but AWS leads by pure revenue; Not in my experience, but I could be wrong.; Good question.  But don't go that way. Pick 1. Be good. Another person said terraform. Yes deployment using that gives you a lot of leverage; They are literally the same thing.\n\n\"How good you are\" -- At doing what? Engineering and developing things that, presumably, the employer wants you to do for them? Yeah, that's what we're talking about here.\n\nCertifications are formal testaments to some degree of fundamental knowledge. Being certified implies that there is a higher likelihood that you can competently satisfy your role's requirements, and thus the employer can invest more time and resources into interviewing and hiring you for the role than someone who simply claims to have the skills.; God bless your heart. Three nipples is not better than two. Knowing stuff is not same as building stuff.; Knowing how to build stuff counts as knowing stuff.\n\nIn any case, strictly speaking, having a cert is better than not having a cert, especially when it's related to the role.\n\nEdit: Also, there is something called *Procedural Knowledge*, which is the knowledge of how to do things, which is contrasted with *Declarative Knowledge*, which is knowing what things are but not necessarily how to do them.\n\nFlat-out saying \"Doing things > Knowledge\" misses the point. Employers often prefer candidates with certifications. To anticipate your counter, I am *not* saying that employers *do not* prefer experience."

He was there before chatgpt and all so he is on paper making a killing (so for him, it's worth it). For those entering at 90 billion valuation... uh, valuation matters. Unless you really believe OpenAI will dominate the market, those PPUs (if it even is worth anything) are probably not the price at face value. Didn't Microsoft at the time \"only\" value at 29 billion?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I guess another part is: I value PPUs at zero. Do I believe OpenAI will achieve \"AGI\". Absolutely not. And technically, those PPUs are worth zero in the long run if OpenAI does not achieve \"AGI\" first.\n\nNow, is the talent high? Absolutely. Plenty of MIT professors also working with OpenAI. As for my interviewers, I had an interviewer who worked at Deepmind. Insane talent. I've absolutely never seen that kind of talent when I was interviewing for jobs. But I also know peers at OpenAI and know there's plenty of normal everyday people there.\n\nI still would take basically every other tech company over OpenAI. But then again, I don't value money as I used to (already am fine financially). I took pay cut for my current remote work with great WLB.; Idk but at MSFT they are cramming Copilot down everyone’s throats and deprioritizing every project and feature that doesn’t use GPT. Finding it hard to drink the koolaid.; I do those freelance AI training gigs that I see advertised everywhere. I definitely was ready for it to be some kind of scam, but it's been more than 6 months now and still going strong. I work maybe 25 hours a week, when I want. Get paid around $40 an hour. And the work is relatively easy, but does require a really careful eye for detail and good understanding of how to review written work and enforce style guidance.  Speaking from what I've seen in traditional programming work in the past, those kinds of skills are hard to find in the CS field so I understand why they're willing to pay so much for the people who can do it. Definitely not counting on the gravy train to hold out forever, but for the time being it's really reliable, well paying work once you get situated with the right company so I'm not complaining.; I love that all the top replies to this question are pure conjecture from people with no experience, something I'm sure the OP could have imagined himself if he wanted.; They’re not going to tell you; “Rightfully so for a good career move” \n\nYou do realize AI is a bubble right? Sure they are useful but even ChatGPT has a difficult time making profit, and actually at times go into the red. \n\nOpenAI and Anthropic will still be around after the bubble bursts but most if not all other AI companies will fall by the waist; People really think \"AI companies\" are just hiring randoms. Do you have a MS/PHD in the field with relevant experience?; [removed]; Is there any big AI company where you get to work on computer vision products and not LLMs or generative AI?; [removed]; I work for a big name company doing LLM training infra work. I've worked at one of the unicorn+ startups doing LLM work as well.\n\nThe technical challenges are fun and exciting. We regularly get to see problems at scales that our industry have never seen before. The stress is manageable. A lot of the pressure is very team and manager dependent like any job. My manager now asks in our weekly 1:1 how the stress levels are and I think takes it very seriously. They've taken things off my plate when I've said I was getting overwhelmed. The pay at the startup was decent, but so much in monopoly money. My pay now is *quite* generous, assuming the stock stays where it is or grows.; Are they? They hire very few so how can everyone...; I am hoping to see OpenAI's employee comment on this.; Tryna increase stupid internet points; Yea mediocre pay on the promises of options being worth something some day; *dedicates life work to automating self out of work*; One year ago I thought OpenAI was going to take over the world.\n\nNow, I think they have no moat and no way to justify their valuation.\n\nAnthropic has proved that OpenAI had no LLM secret sauce when they put out Claude Opus, which in my experience is superior to ChatGPT 4 in the majority of use.\n\nMeta is open sourcing LLM that are close in performance. Google's LLM is not as good but they can integrate it in all of their products to bring value.; > I recall during the pandemic, a lot of tech employees were considering companies like Plaid, Flexport, Nuro, etc.\n\nThat's very true. I remember a few years ago, the hottest pre-IPO companies to join were like Brex, Roblox, Figma, Affirm, Snowflake etc. People were jumping from good careers at FAANG to work there. But looking back if they just stayed at Amazon or Google the whole time, it would've been better for them financially.\n\nThere is a lot of hype in this industry around the \"next hot pre-IPO\" but imo once a company has that reputation, it's probably too late for any life-changing upside."

   "Title": "QA Analyst or Programmer Analyst Intern?",
   "Top Comments": "Do you have an offer for both of these positions or are you trying to decide which position to apply for?\n\nIf you haven't applied for either, apply for both.  Only 1 result in an offer.  In which case, if you need a job then I'd take that job and keep applying.\n\nNow if you have 2 outstanding offers.  First off, nice work.  \n\nI assume long term you want to be a software dev.  You don't really want to do QA as a career, but the 100k salary is really tempting.  Honestly, I'd take the 53k internship and bust my ass so that the company has no choice but to hire me at the end as the 93k full time employee.  This is assuming you can make ends meet at 53k.  If you want to be a developer as a long term goal and 53k is around the starting salary for that kind of work in your area.  You're going have to go down that road at some point.  You might as well do it now.  It'll be hard to take a job as a QA analyst, get used to the 100k salary then try to justify taking a 50k pay cut to start your career as a dev.  Anyway that's my 2 cents.  Good luck!; I'm in a similar situation (down to having signed paperwork for the lower programming one and waiting on a written offer from the higher paying but less relevant one). I've decided to take the first job unless something crazy with the second offer comes through that I can't turn down. Choosing a \\~50k role over one that doubles your salary feels like and is a huge gamble but chances are another opportunity to make programming work full-time might not come around for a while. \n\nYou should be really sure of your finances and comfort level before making this decision but I think you're in a good spot. Keep your options open and apply to those companies you mentioned when you have some more experience and talking points. \n\nCongrats on your offers; So I have the 53k offer in hand to start in 1 week. Filling out paper work.\n\nThe 103k offer to start in one month was given verbally yesterday. Waiting on the written offer via email. \n\nThanks for the advice. I don't want to get stuck in QA forever. Testing is okay but I want to build things and perhaps in a 10 years move on to Product/ Project Management. There is also the fear that I turn down this 53k offer only for the 103k offer to fall through even though it's in the public sector. Alot can change in  a month.; Thanks and congratulations also. Have you started on your low end offer yet?\n\nAlso isn't it funny how you send resume and do interviews with no luck, only to eventually end up in a situation with two offers at the same time?🤦‍♂️😂; Don't listen to the this guy. This is terrible advice. \n\n103k should be a no brainer if you can secure it. You can continue to look for jobs that pay more afterwards but DO NOT take the 53k offer. It tempted to think \"oh I'll take this low paying job to get my foot in the door for a year and then I'll make 103k or more doing what I love\". The truth is you might make that rapid pay bump or you might get stucked making below 100k for many years, especially in today's market. And any year you're not making 103k, which you could be making starting next month, is an opportunity cost. This means you will need to get a job that pays a lot more than 103k eventually to make up the money you lost.; I wish I started in QA. I don’t care about pidgeonholing I don’t like working with no automated tests.; It's also very possible to move from qa to dev. I see it all the time. \n\n\nYou should ask yourself this question before you sleep.  And let your subconscious mind give you the answers.  ; Starting the first week of June. I'm feeling good about my decision, I can always apply to other roles in the meantime and I'll be gathering relevant work experience. Besides I remind myself the verbal offer isn't finalized until a written one comes through. Maybe you can ask if the QA place would let you do more than automated and manual testing, I'm going to ask the second place how much flexibility they'd have to let me work on side projects. I know your decision is tougher because I'm looking at a difference of around 20k and you're deciding on 50k. \n\nAnd yeah the timing has been pretty funny. A week ago I was planning on working at my campus library's IT helpdesk over the summer so this has been a surprising turn of events; Do you think it would make sense to take the 53k offer, work for about 3 weeks, and then switch to the 103k offer? Note: that both would pay monthly so it wouldn't event reach a compensation cycle.; Noted and thanks for the advice; Right. 50k is a huge difference. Like I would just be able to breathe.\n\nCongrats again. If I remember, I'll let you know what I end up choosing.  And if it's the 103k, I hope and pray it does not fall through.; Do you want to work for this company that pays 53k in the future? If no then there's no harm doing it. But personally I wouldn't because working for a job for only 3 weeks sounds like a hassle. If you really need the money then it's a different story.\n\nJust tell them you have to quit for a family emergency"

   "Top Comments": "You need to ask your manager about how you can promote your work.\n\nAt most companies, teams and orgs have dedicated meetings (monthly, bi-weekly, or even weekly) where people have the opportunity to present what they are working on, what they have accomplished, or what big projects they plan to do. Or, teams/orgs can at least schedule them ad-hoc if the overall demand to present isn't super high.\n\nIf your company is large enough, they may also host internal conferences where you can present things at.\n\nYou can even do external conferences if your company is okay with that.\n\nPossibilities are endless, but again, you have to ask what your manager.; would need more info, e.g. what opportunities you have to demonstrate/talk about your work such as sprint demos, meetings with your skip manager,; How vocal are you during meetings?; The best way is to do work with horizontal impact, then discuss it organically, affecting others' projects and having them carry your message. Most projects aren't horizontal, but you can add elements yourself.\n\nGenerally, don't promote your work in isolation; do it by involving other teams or orgs for mutual help, knowledge shares, etc.; Engage w/ people outside your team. There are two general ways to do this: listening to what their problems are (and then fixing them) or presenting the things that you did do.; When your work impacts other departments.  Go to those departments and ask for feedback on how those changes have worked out for them.\n\nFor example, I make a change that improves the efficiency of a process for a department.  Once completed, I'll know how long the process took before the change and how long it takes after.  I'll also know how many times this process is used in a month or year and how much the company has saved in time based on the change.\n\nI'll go to the department and ask them if they've noticed things being faster doing said process and if it has helped them since I made a change.  I already know the answer down to the second.  I'm just putting it in their head that I made their process faster.  I also ask them if there's any other changes or improvements they would like to see made.  Those suggestions will probably go no where, but it's part of selling myself and letting them know I'm working to help them.  \n\nIf you do something like update software or things that have no visible impact on other departments.  Those are a harder sell.  \n\nWhat is your role by the way?; Two tips. \n\n1. Don't worry too much about how you come across. Just don't lie about your work, and you'll be fine.\n\n2. Working with others is a great way to get exposure. If you help them out, they'll usually feel inclined to talk about you for you. If they help you, you can talk about yourself while you're giving them credit for the assist. You'll come across as humble even though it's lowkey a brag. Either way, it's mutually beneficial and bonus points for looking like a team player.; In the left corner, coming in at 186 lbs\n\n\nHe singlehandedly wrote this feature\n\n\nAhhhhhhhhh [crowd cheers]\n\n\nThank you thank you, I did it for you; 🤣"

I am senior mle that works on ml platform/library stuff.\n\nStrong/ideal resume would be mix ml related experience + swe related experience. For example ml research 1 summer + swe internship a different summer. Either one by itself is still solidly helpful and step forward.\n\nAlso title ml infra can easily lean more ml or more infra. My experience is those roles usually lean much more heavily on infra and ml knowledge is a lot less used then you may expect. As examples of ml infra work I see is optimizing model serving latency by exploring reduced precision/tensorrt/onnx, by implementing more efficient feature extraction/ingestion pipelines, building workflow job scheduling systems (like airflow/kubeflow), building training data pipelines and working with both batch/streaming jobs, tuning stuff like malloc/networking settings, benchmarking databases/file formats to find better fit to large datasets involved, exploring alternative cloud hardware/benchmarking, etc. Many of those projects are built for sake of ml but require relatively little ml knowledge.\n\nSo while I give ml research 6/7 in how resumes tend to be reviewed, I think swe experience is more valuable for typical job tasks.\n\nI do encourage applying to variety of companies that are your goal but also keep in mind your first job out of college does not lock you at all. I worked at small relatively unknown cv startup for my first job. I left a year later to a job most would consider more desirable.; Thanks for your reply, it was a busy week for me so I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.\n\nThis may be my last summer, (depending on how far ahead I extend my graduation). What I currently have are DB and Infra projects + Research + AWS and Kubernetes certifications. I have dealt with KubeFlow, onnx, quantization/pruning for an HPC course before. Do you think several high quality projects - such as a SaaS platform for ML Image Processing using the techniques you've described before can help compensate for the lack of traditional SWE experience? \n\nThanks."

I get to play on a computer all day for what most people would consider a good salary and for that I am greatful. Although this is something that I mostly acknowledge intellectually. I don't actually feel that way because software engineering is all I've ever known work wise.\n\nMy question is this.. Do you guys feel like you work hard? I honestly feel like the number of days where I have actually worked hard is single digits. And even that has been a burst of a few hours.. not grinding for 8-10 hours in a day.\n\nMost of the time I am totally bored. Scrolling on Twitter or Reddit for a good amount of time each day.\n\nThis is not to say that I don't do my work. I think that everyone I have worked for has been more than satisfied with my output. I always solve the problems that I am given. Most of my work involves taking someone else's solution and tailoring it to my own (lol) OR asking some or other LLM to code up a few sentances describing a problem and them tweeking it accordingly. Is this normal? Most of the time I feel as though anyone could do my job.\n\nOh well, rant over.\n\nPS I truly hope that this does not come accross as cocky.

Reading about this makes me think that these engineers have limited time and context, and review your code when they can, which is OK \n\nIdeally, you need someone to help review your code, or more support from your manager/TL. I've had a manager say it's on me to harass coworkers more to get code reviewed, and to be relentless. \n\nWhat that really means is that your manager isn't supportive, and frankly creating a shit work culture. Dunno if that's the case for you tho; Write smaller PRs bro; If you are working on a scrum/agile team, you can mark your story as *blocked* status because there's a dependency (i.e. engineers having less capacity for PR review). You should also emphasize your PR being blocked (or needs reviews) during every standup meetings. Squeaky wheel gets the grease.; First of all, how big and complex are your PRs? I don't think people should ignore them, but the bigger and more complex they are, the more time it takes to review them. Most people avoid reviewing large PRs for that reason. Like, if they need to dedicate 1-2 hours to review something, that is a huge pain.\n\nIf there is no way to reduce your PR sizes, then start adding review comments to your own PRs. You can basically use these comments to give context to help people review easier/faster. You don't need to point out the obvious, but you can leave comments like, \"this function is mainly used to enhance performance so that my new feature can do XYZ. See file abc.py for how it integrates with the main application.\" Those kinds of things.\n\nAlso, don't just _tell them_ that you need a review on a large PR. You say, \"hey, I have this PR I need reviewed. I know it is a bit complex and large, so can you quickly scan it (30 seconds) and let me know if you would like me to setup a 10 min meeting? I can go over the PR so you can understand the context faster.\"; I’ve had similar issues and the key issue is when teams don’t view PR reviews as a high priority.\n\nWhen a manager simply expects this to be handled by they author, they’re denying their own influence on team culture. Here’s a line of questions that are good to ask:\n\n1. Do we consider shipping code (ideally quality code) to be a high priority?\n2. Do we believe all shipped code needs to be reviewed and approved?\n3. Do we consider reviewing code a high priority?\n\n\nIf they say no to 3, then how can we consider shipping code a high priority if we don’t consider all dependencies to shipping code a high priority? \n\nIf they say yes to 3, then why do we not have a process in place that makes sure we are delivering on this high priority and helps us improve when we aren’t?\n\n\nUltimately, this needs to be spelled out because a lot of teams and management simply assert that PR will get reviewed appropriately and without a process in place. They’d like to simply drop the issue and put the onus on the author because that is easier to implement.; There's lots of good advice in here.\n\nIn general, I would say that if you TRULY have no venue to tell the team or a manager \"My work is bottlenecked because I can't get reviews, how can we address this?\", it's probably a toxic team.\n\nIt doesn't matter how new your team lead/EM is by the way, this is a basic-ass problem that they should feel directly accountable for fixing immediately.; I think this is something a lot of people early in their careers struggle with.  So don't stress out about it too much.  One thing I've noticed is that people can sometimes get defensive when asked for updates.  It doesn't always mean your boss is hounding you to get it done.  Asking for regular updates, asking how much longer it'll take, asking what blockers exist etc, is just part of the process.   Just be sure to clearly communicate the details when asked.  \"Yeah, code's complete.  (senior) made some suggestions, so I implemented those and it's awaiting his review.  I'm getting started on (other thing) in the meantime.\"\n\nGiven the sizeable layoffs, the senior engineers are likely disgruntled, overworked, and burned out.  This is likely also contributing to things taking longer.  Be careful not to sound like you're blaming those engineers.  Just state matter-of-factly that the ticket is awaiting their response.  Everybody needs to be understanding that the situation has caused work to slow down.\n\n\n\nThere's team-wide changes that sometimes need to be made to ensure code reviews are done in a timely manner, but there's also individual effort that can help.  Some things I'd recommend:\n\n- Try your best to keep PRs small.  Small means it takes less time to review.  If it's small enough, they'll tackle it between other tasks instead of having to make time for it, which means it'll get addressed faster.  If a task can be broken down into multiple separate deliverables, create a separate PR for each of them.  Some of this is going to depend on company culture, so float the idea past your coworkers early on when you start working on the next thing.\n\n- Make sure you're not getting the same feedback multiple times.  You mention multiple rounds back-and-forth, and this is normal and healthy early on, provided the feedback is about different things each round.  Sending code back for review after addressing some but not all of the issues is a great way to get put in a corner, so make sure you're not doing that.  Gitlab and github both have features to mark a thread as resolved.  Don't send anything back to re-review until all outstanding comments are resolved.; >I’m very behind on a project (about 3 weeks),\n\nBehind according to who/what?\n\nEvery team I've been on, once you push to PR it's out of your hands. The project is behind but YOU aren't.; For larger PRs, I like to organize my commits into easily understood components. Almost like explaining the steps I took to solve the problem. \n\nThat helps people review them a lot quicker cus they understand my reasoning for certain decisions ; [removed]; I think he means well but he is new to the team, has no technical experience in the back and language we work in, and seems to be more interested in being amiable while doing IC work.\n\nHe is pretty understanding about my roadblock. And he does not offer solutions. It is pretty frustrating.; This has always been key for me. From the reviewer side, if it’s small then I’m more willing to take a break and just review it real quick. If it’s long then I’m going to have to set aside some time and I’m more likely to have blocking comments. \n\nSmall PRs are also safer. Releasing smaller changes that go to prod quickly are less likely to have bugs. And if it does have bugs it’s easier to diagnose and fix.; I think you’re right. This particular PR was super hard to break down. The function I wrote had a bunch of dependencies. It was a lot of copy 🍝 but still.; [removed]; Meh, the total amount of code won't change if you split up your PRs, arguably more PRs will add more overhead: more reminders, more slack DMs, and more context switches. In short it depends, but don't split up things just for the sake of splitting up things.  \n  \nThe issue here is that reviewing should be brief and painless in the first place. If you \\*constantly\\* produce code that has two rounds of reviews you either\n\n1) Hasn't consulted people you work with at all and they required a near-total rewrite because the expect something completely different  \n2) The reviewers are too nitpicky\n\nFor the first issue I'd say sync with the team before or during implementing something large/complex, for the latter adopt something like [https://conventionalcomments.org/](https://conventionalcomments.org/) for clearer review communication and talk to them, I bet they don't like that reviews are like pulling teeth either.\n\nBut to be honest, if the issue is #2 you might not be a great cultural/technical fit, I'm not too optimistic that you can change that; Love looking at it this way!; This is a really good idea and solves the “I need lots of changes for this all to work” part.\n\nBut what if they ask for a change in commit 3 of 5?\n\nDo I just lay a commit on top of all 5, saying fix for commit 3 or something like that?; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

   "Top Comments": "First of all, you'll get clowned here for declaring Amazon your dream company and it's probably for the best. But dream however you want. The answer, though, is most likely you'll be fine. If your only contact was a recruiter, then the recruiter is probably the only one that has information on you. Like, they are testing to see if you're worth a behavioral, the HR department isn't going to sniff your info until you're a few stages deep.; No. I think it's a 6 month cooldown on redoing the OA. I crushed the OA and then failed the final rounds. It's a 20 year cooldown for those.\n\nEdit: 2 year cooldown; The idea of a \"blacklist\" is for things that are grossly unprofessonal. It means that you've done something so bad that no matter how much you improve in the future the company wants no part of you. Even if you become a genuis, and the top 0.00001% of SWE's.\n\nIt's not really even called a \"blacklist\", it's just a \"not eligible for (re)hire\" label on your candidate profile. It's a list for serious, un-fixable things, like lying/fraud, reneging, etc.\n\nWhat you're describing is not that.\n\nFailing an interview, even in glorious fashion, is just a one-time thing. The company already decided to even give you that OA, so they must've seen *something* in you. They don't want to throw that away. Most companies have a 6 month cooldown before they consider candidates that failed the process previously. So in 6 months time... reach back out.\n\nAnecdotally I talked to Amazon once upon a time (before I knew better). I was in college, they were on campus for the career fair, and they gave me a live simple-ish coding problem on the spot. I absolutely fucked it up. Not even close to scoring another intervew. Obviously didn't get a follow up from them.\n\nAnd then guess what's I've been dealnig wth throughout the rest of my 11 year career after college? Spam from Amazon/AWS recruiters.

There's no such thing. There's ***millions*** of companies in the US alone, and you're gonna say Amazon is your \"dream company\" without ever working a day for them? Come on. Realistically, if you *had* joined Amazon, what would happen is you get laid off or fired in 2-3 years because they're brutal about that stuff, and now you have an empty hole in your heart. Cause your \"dream company\" just dropped you like a bag of bricks without a second thought.; lol why you want to work there?; I no longer work at Amazon, but while I was there I was involved in literally hundreds of interviews. I've never heard of anyone getting blacklisted at the interview stage for anything that wasn't a literal HR or safety concern.; I understand. I am afraid that those types of intel are held and when I apply later they'll cause problems.\n\n  \nAnd yeah I had it coming for having AWS as my dream company lmao.; How recent is that info? It was still 6 month cooldown back in 2021 for failing the final round.; Well, I'm even okay to 1-2 year. I just don't wanna get blacklisted. I think I need 1 year of consistent LC at least to have a chance at tech interviews with AWS tbh so 6 months is fine for me lol.; I understand.

One thing to note is that due to its structure and culture, who your management chain is is way more important to your effectiveness and happiness at Amazon than at most other companies. When you interview again, ask a lot of questions of the hiring manager. How do they think about work prioritization? What's the team's operations load like? How many times a week does the oncall get paged? How many people has the manager promoted in the last few cycles? Etc.\n\nBest of luck with your next Amazon interview cycle.; Sounds like romanticism.

The fact that you are only a freshman, going to a T10, have a TA job, internship and research position puts you miles above alot of other people. Really.\n\nAs someone with 2 years experience in industry so far, the imposter syndrome really never goes away. But that is totally normal. I would only be concerned if you were not feeling it at all. \n\nFailing is a part of learning. Yea in some aspects people may be better than you at some things but you are better at others. Everyone is different in their skillsets.\n\n>  \nHow the hell am I suppose to compete when I picked up programming in my senior year of high school?\n\nMost people do not start coding until college.\n\nStay in CS if you really enjoy it. Based on your experience you have both a good start towards getting into PHD programs if that is your goal and getting a good start to your career.\n\n  \n**As someone who was on this sub all the time in college and after. One of the best things I ever did for my mindset was dropping this sub. Yea I come here every now and again but this sub is a cesspool.**\n\nJust keep grinding and with your experience so far will be fine; No, the legal field is super saturated; what does “switch to law with a cs minor” mean? There is no such thing as an undergraduate law degree in the US; I hosted Google STEP interns. FYI, it's for people who aren't that great, lol. It's a fallback if you didn't qualify for the traditional intern program, but they think you have promise. It's a bit like Eng residencies for new grads.\n\nAnyway, you're hyperventilating. You'll be fine. If you pursue law, you'll be doing the career equivalent of a deer running into traffic. It's the actual representation of everything that scares you about CS.;  yes its joever switch to law; No. Don't switch to law. Law school is fucking expensive as hell and depending on what you would want to do in law (aka do you wanna help companies fuck over workers/customers/etc? No? then expect to never pay off your loans) it could be tough to ever recoup that cost. Unless you have a passion for law, I would not at all recommend it. I got this advice from a friend who worked in patent law for a while before leaving to be an office manager at a nonprofit because it was more fulfilling.\n\nI'm 31, did a bootcamp in 2020, worked the last few years as a dev, got laid off, and now I'm doing an emails and customer support job while I keep looking for something better. I wish I had the skills you probably already have, but in the meantime I'm just gonna work somewhere I can handle that pays Enough while I keep learning and skilling up. For you, I'd say either stick it out at your program and ignore what other people are doing, or switch to something you actually like (again, unless you are PASSIONATE about law, don't do that) and get the minor. The skills you will learn in your CS program can be helpful in any number of jobs aside from just dev jobs. Places need PMs, BAs, people who just know technical stuff. Even if it's just how to talk about it (kinda where I'm looking now because I'm good at communication based on my jobs before learning basic web dev). \n\nMain takeaway here is don't just switch to law unless you DESIRE to be reading about the intricacies of labor, patent, immigration, criminal, family, tax (SNORE), or M&A law. Also, don't assume the legal job market is all hunky-dory. My aforementioned friend said a lot of people in the Great Recession got law degrees hoping for good jobs and oversaturated that market then.

   "Top Comments": "When I came to CA my expenses went up, but so did my income. It was absolutely a good deal financially.; I explain this all the time too. People want to feel like victims when they are obviously coming out way on top, even if the ratio isn't perfectly balanced, in the vast majority of situations you are better off in the higher COL city with higher salary. Also most of the things you could ever buy are the same across the country. Cars, health insurance, electronics, entertainment, vacation/flights, etc. Basically the only stuff that is scaling is housing, food, gas, tax. And if you are paying a mortgage, that \"extra\" housing cost is practically entirely negated as you build equity. \n\nPeople on reddit act like they would rather be living in India, making $10,000/year but with only $3,000 in expenses instead of living in the Bay Area making $500k/year but with $400k/yr expenses. In one situation, after 10 years you're now well over a millionaire and go live literally anywhere else in the world with extra purchasing power, and in the other situation, you're still stuck in India forever, even with a 3.5x higher savings rate.\n\nBut the dumbest part is people trying to pretend like housing is 6x more expensive in SF as they compare the price of a single family home in Tulsa, OK to a single family home in downtown SF. Like no shit, buying a home in a massive city where they don't belong is going to be expensive. No one moves to NYC and claims that housing is 37x more expensive but their salary is only 2x since they are trying to find the same exact SFH on 0.6 acre lot that they could theoretically have in the Houston exurbs. And regardless if you are owning the property it's less of a big deal anyway.; Working and living in a low CoL area is essentially devaluing your currency relative to the American average. Work in high, retire low.; One of the things that makes HCOL/VHCOL areas so discouraging for high earners is that marginal lifestyle improvements are still unattainable. \n\nI moved from Utah to San Francisco and went from $80k to $180k, and my quality of life went down. Sure, my savings went up and I took advantage of that, but even getting up to $350k I'm still no closer to my goal of home ownership... something I could have afforded at $120k back in Utah.; Yep. Also, alot of consumer goods are priced at a national level. Car prices aren't generally higher in HCOL areas. A PS5 costs the same no matter what part of the country you're buying it in. \n\nLiving in a HCOL area means that you save more money, and can always cash in by moving to a LCOL area.  The reverse is not true.; I always hear people saying 180k in CA is like 70k in TX which couldn’t be farther from the truth. Even at an exaggerated HCOL tax rate and rent cost (36%, 4k/month), 180k comes out to be 67.2k take-home pay. And at a very generous LCOL tax rate and rent cost (24%, 1k/month), 70k comes out to be 41.2k take-home pay. Yea sure food and groceries are more expensive but that’s a pretty small percentage of your expenses compared to rent/taxes/large purchases like cars/etc. Despite making it as favorable as possible for LCOL and as unfavorable as possible for HCOL, that’s still a 26k take-home pay difference. That’s a whole car lol.; It's extremely dependent on whether you have children or heck, what kind of living situation you hope to be in.\n\n  \nIf your one goal is to have a family and raise them on a big lot home a commute away from your work than COL adjustment would in fact be as good as the people here often say it is. \n\n  \nOtherwise it's likely exaggerated; Another thing people often don't consider.  While home prices are more expensive, if you buy your home, your mortgage payment will be higher, but a good chunk of that payment goes into your own equity. That part is more like putting money into savings than an expense, as you can later downsize or move to LCOL; Also you totally don't have to live in the very expensive part of the high cost of living areas. You can live in New Jersey. You can live in Staten Island or Queens. You can live far out in the Bay. If you're remote or even hybrid, that's a higher income and still decently low expenses.\n\nI don't understand people who use money as a reason why they don't want to do big tech. There's a lot of excellent reasons not to do big tech. Money isn't one of them.; Yep, I had people tell me \"well 200k I'm Seattle is actually like 60k in bumfuck.\" Bro I *invest* at least 60k a year. Can't do that on a 60k salary.; Sure, but the numbers you’re using aren’t accurate? They are massively exaggerating the difference.\n\nFor example, the average SWE pay in [SF vs Denver](https://builtin.com/salaries/dev-engineer/software-engineer) is 172k vs $142k.  [The cost of living](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/san-francisco-ca-vs-denver-co) is 36% higher in SF than Denver.\n\nIf you had an average home with an average salary you’d come out ahead in savings in Denver.\n\nObviously if you live frugally you can come out ahead with higher pay, but that’s not what people are arguing when they say the Bay Area isn’t worth the difference in pay.\n\nIt’s a personal decision for everyone. As a man with a wife and 2 kids it’s absolutely not with the pay increase to move to SF for myself. I’m happily at $170k in Minneapolis and have a 3k sq/ft house in a nice neighborhood. I would come out way below where I’m at in terms of living comfort and savings unless I landed a job paying me $400k (as my wife’s industry won’t double her pay for a move to SF); It's not that the math stumps people, it's that the math doesn't generally add up that when your cost of living increases by X that the new comp will also increase by X.\n\nIt's also that if you're married and your spouse doesn't work in tech, then your salary may increase by X, but their may not.\n\nIt's also that even when you say the cost of living increases by X, that is normally based on the average house. If you have kids, that may mean going from a 3 or 4 bedroom house to a 2 bedroom house - and that kinda sucks.\n\nSo in some cases you're talking about your costs increasing by 100%, your income increasing by 50%, and your quality of life decreasing by 30%.\n\nI think where the math works out the best is for young, single people. Because that's when you're most able to sacrifice comfort and materialize that proportionality you're taking about.; The problem is not that people can't make the calculation, but that it's a lot more personal, and the numbers can vary depending on life phase and choices.\n\n20 years ago when I was a fresh graduate in a low cost of living area with limited job options, I probably could have saved a lot more money by moving to an expensive area and earning a lot more money.  By choosing to stay put, I got to live with my parents and save on rent for a few years.  But, even paying for my own room in a more expensive city, I probably could have saved more money if I'd earned more money.  Sometimes, I think it would have been smarter to make that choice.\n\nBut, 20 years later, my expenses look very different.  I've chosen to get married and have kids, and I want things for my family like a house with a yard and separate rooms for everyone.  I also need to pay for child care.  So, living in a place where houses are cheap and day care if affordable goes a long way.  It's also really nice to have my parents nearby, because they provide free baby sitting, and I don't have to buy plane tickets if I want to see them.\n\nCould I have spent the first few years of my career in an expensive city and moved back to my hometown when I was ready to start a family? Sure. But, it probably would have been challenging to find a partner to move with me and to leave behind friends.\n\nIt's also worth noting that my salary really isn't that much worse than people living in more expensive cities.  With the rise of remote work, the gap has closed considerably.  But, even before that, I remember looking and seeing that I could get a 30% raise to move to a city where housing and child care were twice as expensive.\n\nI really can't complain about being in my early 40s, having a fully paid for house, and being on track to send kids to college and retire in about 10 years.  Could I have more money saved if I'd moved to earn more money earlier in my career? Possibly.  But, having more absolute dollars would only help if I was going to move somewhere less expensive to spend them.; There’s no objective formula because it really depends on your lifestyle. If you want to live in a one bedroom apartment and you don’t have any hobbies other than video games, SF won’t be that much more expensive than say Raleigh NC. But if you really want to live in a house instead of an apartment, or you have hobbies that require lots of space, your lifestyle will be incredibly expensive or impossible in SF.\n\nFor example I have a 3 bedroom house, I golf a lot, I go out to eat a few times a week, I like to have some space. For me to have the same lifestyle in California I’d need to make at the very least, 250k a year maybe more. I currently make 135k and it’s enough to support that lifestyle and save a good amount on top. Going to California would absolutely be a downgrade in my lifestyle with the offers I could realistically get.\n\nReally when it comes to deciding where to spend your life and put down roots, don’t make that decision based on “well I hate this area and my life would be worse but I’d be able to save 30k more per year”.; My income drop less then the amount I'm saving from moving; Okay?; I'm from the UK, so will use numbers there. Let's say the two options are:\n\n1) Earning £120k pre-tax in London (HCOL) with £40k expenses.\n2) Earning £60k in LCOL with £20k expenses.\n\nOn 1), you take home £64k (after pension, tax and student loan), which leaves you with £24k after expenses.\n\nOn 2) you take home £39k, which is £19k after expenses.\n\nThere isn't that much difference, and expenses could also be a lot more than double in London compared to LCOL.; Aren't you paying more in taxes and other miscellaneous bills as the COL goes up; Your taxes go up too; Problem is when it isn't 2x for 2x, it might be 1.3x income for 2x expenses... Every salary is different."

   "Top Comments": "People think when the Fed starts cutting rates the tech industry will pick up. Little do they know there is a delay between rate cuts and companies ramping up hiring. Especially if only a handful of 25bps cuts are made, rates will still be restrictive for small businesses until 2026-2027.; I don't know and it's keeping me up at night; I remember graduating college in 1997.  Not exactly sure what I was going to do, so I did apply for jobs in marketing and also took on temp work. Was privately playing with web design, and then an HR person suggested I pursue it as a career.\n\nStill struggled until I landed a spot in a startup in 1999.  I had been unemployed for roughly 3 years with just temp work and an internship,  I had left a retail job I was at in 1995 because they hit me with 39.5 hours a week, and I could not do that and keep up with school. 1996 I lost my other weekend job and was struggling to make an income since then through my graduation.\n\nNow then, the dotcom startup went belly-up in mid-2001, and I was out of work again. I spent 2 years doing various things I could find, like contract/freelance, and then another retail job which I only did seasonal because I decided to do grad school, and it was clear this job would once again infringe on times I needed to be off so I could attend classes.\n\nThen in 2003 I got a job with a pay cut in a small company doing their websites, and left in 2006 because this place was a mess and was moving to the burbs. I did 13 years after that in advertising, not jumping ship because it was the Great Recession, but then was laid off in early 2019.  Took me 10 months after that to get a new job.\n\nI told you all this because in my career, I've never had a short stint of unemployment.  Some people are lucky and can land a new job in a month or two, but for me, it's always months or years...and each time I've seen how slow and inefficient companies are in recruiting. Many taking months to finally call me.\n\nNow at the age of 50, I always worry I'll get let go, and anywhere I apply will only see my age, and nothing more. What's hilarious is these companies complain how young people can't be managed and are lazy, but they won't hire older people.  I think if I was unemployed in this, I'd be hitting up all those recruitment agencies that many hate, and apply for jobs, and take on any contract work I can just to keep going and get my feet in the door.\n\nIf I hit one year of not even a rejection, then I'd start exploring graphic design jobs, art direction, and working people I know in agencies to see if they need people.\n\nI don't know what to suggest. I feel like everyone now runs their resume through AI and just rapid-fire applies to any job they see online. So now companies are flooded with said resumes, and even say how most of them are unqualified, but they're spending too much time sifting through piles like spam emails.\n\nAll I can advise any of you is to network, try to get someone in a senior or higher position to look at your resume and just be honest on if they think you're desirable to employers...and what you're missing that they're looking for.  I hear too many stories of people with minimal skills, or no soft skills, or other issues, but they think it's all companies being stingy.  Even those recruiters showed me I needed more than just UX case studies, and it helped.\n\nIf you choose to change, then look into trade schools for some in-demand thing, like welding.; [removed]; August. I have no idea what I’ll transition to, but by August I’ll be hitting less than a year of living expenses. And that’s after cashing out my house.; Why wait? There is nothing stopping you from continuing to apply while working at a warehouse or something. You're going to have a gap either way.; I'm starting to try to branch out a bit to roles like help desk, systems engineer/admin, or network engineer so that I can have a job while applying for dev positions.  It helps that I have some experience with tech support already and one of the career paths I would like to take is cybersecurity/pen testing where I can combine dev with other general IT work.; the market always does this, i try have a few years savings; Git gud; I would be more worried if there are notable rate cuts.

It doesn't matter that you didn't pass last time for a lower grade. \nRegarding the difference, I don't have sde I interview experience, but for sde II you will have a system design interview probably. Expect LP questions on every interview, regardless if it's coding, system design, or behavioral. Behavioral will have more of them. Coding part is most likely the same questions, but probably a bit less room for bugs. Behavioral part and LP - they will expect answers with more impact, relative to SDE I. Like instead of story how you get a task from team lead and successfully implemented it the way they suggested, the story how you had to interact with another team and solve some disagreement or improved some process for the entire team will be better.; SDE 2 won’t be significantly harder than SDE 1, in terms of LC.  There’s one system design type interview. \n\nGet leadership principle stories ready, and brush up on system design. And LC as always.  Try to have ~2 stories per leadership principle. Google LP interview questions. \n\nBest of luck.; The coding interviews will be approximately the same difficulty, depending on who you get and their questions of course. \n\nThe system design is about what you'd expect. Could be \"design an online bookstore\" or other things of that nature. They'll drill down or ask questions about specific areas and you basically just keep asking clarifying questions. ; You know, confirm with your recruiter regarding system design interview before spending time to prepare for it.; Thank you 👍; Got it\n Thanks 👍; Alright thanks for the response!"

Even low experience (1-2 years) can easily exceed 400/500k and higher experience can go significantly higher especially with competing comparable offers. Financial firms can go to 7 figures for senior+ engineers. They have massive paybands and it’s very much how much they want you.; That’s quite the process."

   "Top Comments": "Dude save for your wedding.  Taking a big risk on a high pressure situation when you will need to take time off anyway for wedding planning and attendance and honeymoon stuff... yeah.\n\nThe pressure isn't worth it; IMO no because should your new job go sour, it's uncertain how long it'd take to find another role in this market; Hi everyone!\n\nSo back in college, I had a buddy (lets say his name is Bob) who we both met each other our freshman year of our CS Degree in college. I would say he is probably one of the most gifted people I have ever met both technologically and in terms of how smart he is with business. While we were in college, he ended up with an idea of an app that he wanted to build. We worked on a lot of coding projects together, so we talked about the app a lot. Fast forward 5 years and he managed to build this app, make a company out of it and is aiming to become acquired by a Fortune 500 company. Talks with the higher ups of said company are looking for about $30 million.\n\nWhen I graduated, I earned my way into a job I was underqualified for at the company I interned for. In exchange for getting a job I was underqualified for and the team training me for the role, I had to stay there for three years. It was originally an Analyst position.\n\nNow Bob and I have talked about me going and working for him for some time now, dating all the way back to 2022 when he first gave me an offer to work for the company. I ended up choosing to decline because of the agreement I had with the company I work for. Bob had no hard feelings about me declining the offer from him and even some of the other guys at his company respected me a lot and liked me a lot more for being a man of my word to the company I am currently working at.\n\nFast forward to now and I am officially in a Data Engineer position. While being in the position is great, it feels a little sour because I believe my current company connived to set up my new position where I wasn't entitled to a raise. They took forever to come up with the compensation analysis, and when they finally did, they said I wasn't entitled to a raise because my current comp wasn’t below the lower range of the new position. It feels fishy though because I received that news only 1 month after I got my yearly raise that conveniently JUST put me above the lower range of the new position.\n\nBob and I have continued to talk about the idea of me working at the company for a long time and can even see a time in about September where I'd be able to join the team. At that time, the company would most likely be acquired and I would be working with Bob as a Full Stack guy but with an emphasis on Data Engineering to get all the data transported to the new systems at the company acquiring them. Just this past week though, he called me to say that there may be an opening next week due to him potentially having to let a developer go and he wanted to gauge my temperature on how I feel about joining now. I’d be full time remote and I’d get a 40% pay increase compared to my current comp. This would be full stack coding in Flutter/Dart and API writing using Python (not the Data Engineering aspect of it). I’d have a 90 day preliminary trial to see if I can hold my own and if I manage to “add value to the company”. I’ve coded in Flutter, Dart, and Python before to prepare for the idea of joining in September, but of course my main base of knowledge outside of college now is SQL, ETL tools, and Tableau/Power BI.\n\nIt feels great that I have an opportunity like this, but I can’t help but feel a little paralyzed by fear too. I’m focusing on saving up for a wedding and preparing with my Fiancee to make a big effort to knock out the loans we have. If I were to join the team, my 90 day preliminary period would be ending right before the wedding and I’d hate for the possibility of me not holding my own to become reality and I enter into the marriage without a job. My current job may not have the salary I’d like to have in my given role, but I do excel there so I know I likely wouldn’t lose my job there AND the work/life balance is incredible. The job is really stable and I’m wondering if that’s something good to keep during this job market and general economic outlook. I’m really nervous about the idea of taking the risk and would value the advice of y’all.; If you trust your friend and believe he knows what he’s doing then go for it. Set expectations that you have your wedding coming up in a few months and you will need a few days off to for prep, plus time off for the actual wedding. If they’re cool with that then back yourself and take that 40% pay rise.; do you have enough money saved up for the wedding?; [removed]; This is how I imagine c level execs thinking about the future of their company: \"should I continue following what works and is stable, or risk it by squeezing short term profit with a high chance of the company failing in the near future\"?; No. One is O(n) money. The other may be O(1) money.; If he really wants you, the job will probably still be there after your wedding; Stable jobs are great. You have some major life changes going on. And it’s not an all out no it’s just a no at this time. Have no outstanding debt is a huge relief and allows you to take on some more risk. ; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum account age requirement of **seven** days to post a comment.

   "Title": "The Great Resignation pt 2 is coming",
   "Top Comments": "I mean I hope you're right but the part I absolutely don't think will happen is employers trying to retain talent. As far as I can tell that's just not what they do.; I’ve actually found that this dissatisfaction coupled with a slow economy puts the power in the employer’s hands. You have a smaller amount of open jobs and an increased number of applicants because a large portion of employed people are applying. These people aren’t going to just quit for unemployment. They’re only quitting if they get something else. In essence, lower supply of open jobs and increased supply of applicants means companies can be choosy.\n\nUntil job openings increase by a fair bit and/or people become somewhat satisfied with their jobs, it will be an employer’s market.; I have a feeling a *lot* of employers would love for some dev resignations right now. I heard one of our managers say the other day that our extended teams haven’t had a single person quit in 2 years. They’ve already cut bottom performers to get leaner, and I am sure they’d happily say bye to some people who leave voluntarily right now.\n\nThe market just isn’t good, so nobody is moving.; Can't quit if there is nowhere to go; They got their short-term profits with the layoffs, and now they get the failures from the tech debt, loss of organizational knowledge, and the total collapse of motivation and productivity.; I work in big tech and the levels of burnout, disengagement and low morale have reached unprecedented peaks. \nYes, people are looking for ways out but this is not like 2021/22. Back then you were job hopping to get better perks in terms of compensation, work life balance, respect and flexibility. Today you can job hop but you still find the same shitty hectic environment. I feel people just don’t want to be in tech anymore, what lured people in tech in the first place vanished in favour of politics and BS. You can still make some decent money, but now it’s just an investment banking type of career.\n\nIn short yes, big resignations are building up but this isn’t going to be anywhere similar to 2021/22.; I like my job, or at least I used to. Remote work, doing what I’m good at, and not overburdened.\n\nHowever, it’s pretty clear that the Covid years were great for my company, and the aftermath isn’t what they expected. They, for some reason, expected growth to continue at the same rate, instead it’s declining back to where the growth should have been.\n\nIt’s pretty clear looking at their data that the Covid years were the outlier. Now business is as if Covid never happened. It’s not like they’re doing “bad”. They’re just not “growing”, and if you’re not growing you’re dying apparently. Managers across the board are pushing the panic button. They cut 401k match, they cancelled bonuses they promised, and a slew of other cuts. \n\nNow a high up head d-bag believes we should just buy our software instead building our own stuff. They think it will save money, but I’m sure they have no clue what they’re signing up for. \n\nNone of these people are even slightly technical. They supposedly floated the idea of only having contractors for developers, and only hiring people as they need jobs done. \n\nSo now my job is on the chopping block next year after they finally finish migrating everything. If it even happens that fast. I’m not going to stick around to get a layoff email. I’ll be long gone before then.; Quit to go where, working retail? LOL. Ain't no jobs worth quitting for! I'd love to quit my job for a pay raise and job title increase but that ain't happening.; why am I looking for a job?\n\nshit ton of debt, need high pay\n\nI write code for fun/enjoy making things but I don't enjoy corporate software dev so I do it until I can get out (invest); Yes, this is coming, but not this year.  \nLiterally noone in my team of 30 engineers has resigned during the past 12 months. We have a lot of issues and bullshit. We also used to have large attrition around 2022. The job market is really that bad right now.; Simon Sinek touched on similar. He said what you're seeing are Gen Z are watching their millennial parents get laid off for no reason of their own at a higher frequency than we've ever seen, especially in tech as tech continued to grow in the late 90s and 2000s and all the way now to the 2020s.\n\nSo Gen Z are entering the job force incredibly jaded - They already know employers dont give a shit about them. So you have Millennials who have been getting punched in the dick and already lost trust and are constantly looking out for themselves, and Gen Z witnessed it and therefore are constantly looking out for themselves and dont have trust.\n\nNo one is trusting their employer. Employees are now viewing it as transactional, the same way Employers did that all along. People have been awoken to that reality.\n\nIt's going to be much rare to see employees stay past 4 years at the same company unless you landed in a dream spot with low stress and high pay with low turnover.\n\nHell, Amazon structures their stock compensation so that most of it is year 3 and 4, as they know how many people leave in the first two years.; In the golden market of 2021, companies were desperate to hire ***net-new*** positions.\n\nSo when there was an abundance of openings, it became super easy to job search, get a position, and then quit, which in turn created even more demand at those companies hiring for net-new positions and now needing to backfill on top of that.\n\n\"The Great Resignation\" is a fancy sounding title that misses a key concept. \"The Great Find a New Job Easily and *then* Resign\" would be more accurate.\n\nThat period didn't start purely from people leaving their jobs. That contributed creating a snowball effect, sure, but the root cause was a huge demand for hiring net-new roles. It wasn't *created* from a bunch of people resigning. It was created from market conditions and companies over-hiring. The resignation bit resulted from that.\n\nThe problem with \"The Great Resgnation Part 2\" is that there isn't rampant over-hiring for net-new roles. People in their current rules may not be happy, I'm not disputing that, I was that myself over the past few months, but *there's no rampant over-hiring*.\n\nThe snowball isn't going to even start rolling without that. People being dissatisfied with their jobs might try looking for a new job, but in the vast majority of cases they won't leave without anything lined up. So there's no uncontrolled over-hiring combined with desperate backfilling going.\n\nSo.... again, \"The Great Resignation Part 2\" might not be a great term for this either. Maybe \"The Great Dissastisfaction but Still Hold Down Our Job Cause We're Not Stupid Enough to Leave Before Lining Someting Else Up Which Takes Longer for Us Than It Takes for an Employer to Replace Us Since Nobody's Over-hiring Right Now.\"\n\nIt doesn't roll off the tongue, but it's a better description of what's happening.; Who in their right mind would resign without getting a new job?

If anything those outside interviews are a great way to practice interviewing. \n\nIf you had to prioritize one or the other I would prioritize getting the return offer. This is because you already know how it feels like to work there. But if you realize early on that the company is not a place you want to continue at, or that you probably won’t get an offer, definitely prioritize interviewing externally.\n\nStill try your best to do both. It always helps to have options and get interviewing practice. Hope that helps!; Couldn't you just ask if your current team has the budget / capacity for hiring you on after graduation?\n\nIf they don't or if you're uncertain, then yeah, I'd be for applying. Seems interesting to me that they would offer an internship to you with so little time left in your academic career. Like aren't you going to need benefits once you graduate?; Yeah definitely, but also Check with your company and ask if they have the budget to hire you permanently. My company didn’t so I left because I couldn’t continue to survive off of an intern salary.

This is way below industry average.\n\n> Much more interested in working for Geico after discussion with recruiter and interviewer\n\nFWIW… recruiters are *paid* to hype their companies. It's challenging to really know what culture looks like before agreeing to work at any company. You have limited knowledge and at a certain point just have to make a gut instinct move.\n\n> Eligible for promotion to Senior Software Engineer after 2 years\n\nI'm not sure what this means and how this is a legit pro in favor of going back on your other offer.\n\n> Hearing nothing but bad things about Geico's new CEO and current work culture\n\nThis is a bad sign. It's nearly impossible to onboard as an IC and fix culture. Companies might *say* that everyone owns culture… but IC (especially entry and mid level) don't get to fix culture.; If you take the Geico offer. Make sure you have signed the paperwork first before you turn down your current one.; 7 days PTO and 9 days PTO? Wtf you can’t even take a 2 week vacation.; [deleted]; > Eligible for promotion to Senior Software Engineer after 2 years\n\nEligible and ready are totally different things.  You're a new grad; the chances you'll be in a position to get promoted to senior are objectively low. Also, when making a comparison list, if both sides have the same perk or drawback, there's no point in listing them. It doesn't aid your decision. I'm commenting about this so you are less upset in 2 years.\n\n> In Dallas (will be staying at home to save money)\nIf you're staying home in one job or remote in the other, why wouldn't this be the case in both?\n\nKeep in mind that while you're a candidate, employees are not going to speak negatively about the company. Geico's culture might still be totally fucked, but they're not going to let that show in any interviewing process. Those people are not invited to the interview panel. That being said, the folks on the ground (dealing with customers)  in any business get treated way worse than the tech workers, so you're seeing a little bit of a divide. The end users aren't around to complain in the defense industry, if you know what I mean.\n\nAs to the WFH situation, lots of work is classified even when it probably doesn't need to be. Just expect to be fully in the office at Lockheed, but at least you're only working 4 days a week. 3 day weekends can be really awesome to get errands done or take weekend trips without responsibilities. \n\n\nI think you'd burn the bridge at Lockheed to take the other offer. Normally, I'd take the stability of defense right now over the volatility of the private job market. Lockheed is not likely to do layoffs anytime soon and if you are in this sub, you know how volatile things are. They will continue to be that way for a few more years. However, Todd Combs is not a new CEO, he was a hedge fund manager at Berkshire Hathaway. Their investment strategy is all about safe bets over 20-80 years, so Geico is likely to have a lot of stability. He's been CEO for 4 years and if they have a software engineering role, it's not that risky.\n\nAs to the networking: That's less important than the mentorship drawbacks of remote. Zoom calls introduce a barrier that is unfortunately real and socially taxing compared to chilling at someone's desk and a whiteboard. You can network by simply attending company calls and hang sessions or office hours, or go to local meetups.\n\nGeico will have higher expectations and that will push you more as a junior. Working remotely is a valuable skill to have, especially as time goes on and you'll find yourself working with folks in different offices.\n\nTL;DR - I would choose Geico.; >  I am extremely worried about what reneging my initial offer will do to my reputation in the industry long term\n\nIt doesn't hurt your reputation in the industry, decide which you like better and renege if you have to. Just be polite about it and it won't be a big issue.; Yes.; I have no insight into either company. As a third potential option (something that I did - but it was before I signed my offer) you could go to Lockheed Martin and say that you have a better offer on the table and ask if they're willing to match the money and or PTO. You may be surprised.; I'd say absolutely take Geico in this case. Although in the pros I heard they save you 15% in 15 minutes, not 8%.; No one keeps a record for Reneg just the company you walk away from. They will understand. Don’t disclose where you are going only that you have to walk away from the role. \n\nFully remote is great and you can move in with your parents or just go somewhere that the cost of living is super duper low and live with roommates. Toledo Ohio and then just save as much as you can. ; >Hearing nothing but bad things about Geico's new CEO and current work culture\n\nThat alone should make the decision for you.; Have a friend who joined GEICO TDP and he seems to really enjoy it. \n\nDefense is another beast entirely and there’s a lot more red tape involved\n\nI vote GEICO ; Both are kinda scummy but one actually kills people; Were you blacklisted from the defense industry? How did you tell them you were reneging?; Quite sure that 7 days PTO is not accurate. Unless changed very recently, LM offers a week for sick/personal up front, three weeks accrued over the year, plus a week shutdown at holidays.; So which offer would you take in this scenario?  The bad culture with better pay or the safer option with worse pay?; LM offers 3-4 weeks plus a week holiday shutdown. OP either misunderstood or mistyped.; I put the wrong benefits by mistake.

We never recovered from 2023 layoffs and related bullshittery and this year so far hasn't helped a whole lot; I've been unemployed for 9 months. The past month has been hotter, but still no offer.

In early 2022, I always waited for recruiters to reach out and only apply after I had spoken to them. I guess things don't work the same way now.; 24, I got some bites in early 23, but pretty much nothing since summer/fall 23; Personally 2023 because in 2024 I haven't experienced a role I was applying for being froze after having a perfect interview.; I was laid off early 2023 and it took me 3 1/2 months to find a new position at a startup.

   "Title": "Is contributing to open-source projects worth it at this stage, or what should I do to stay competitive after graduating?",
   "Top Comments": "I feel for you. It's rough out there. I will say that there are certain companies that value \"non-traditional\" or project-based experience more than others. Massive companies like CapitalOne will receive thousands of applications from people that maybe already have real world experience. So that's likely going to be an unfruitful path for you (although you should absolutely go for it!).\n\nHave you considered working at a startup? If your passion is to contribute to open source projects, some companies have open source projects as their source of leads, and then a premium offering which has full-time dev support. NGINX (Acquired by F5) and GitHub (Acquired by Microsoft) are probably the two most notable examples.\n\nIf you're wide open at this point, then I'd definitely just recommend applying for startups in general. Indeed and Linkedin are trash. It's so cluttered. They have to cater to over 1B users of their platform, so it's not catered to you. There are job boards out there that are [specifically built for college students and internships](https://www.talentramp.co). Just gotta know where to look.; college job board?; Contributing to a big project everyone knows helps. Other than that no, no one is gonna check your github. \n\nDefinitely still contribute though, great practice and I've brought open source practices over to big companies. In general some random 5 contributor repo for changing the word dick into big dick will have better documention, composition, and cicd than actual big tech services.; For finding a job, the ROI is pretty low. Open source is mostly passion-driven; no one likes seeing [these PRs](https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup/pull/24)\n\n>I don't know where to start\n\n1. Pick some open source tech you are interested in\n2. Find its repo, figure out how to build it + run tests. (I suspect 90% of prospective contributors don't make it past this step)\n3. Go to the `Issues` page, find open bugs and validate reproduction steps\n\nWhen you are starting out, you don't need to code — just add more details about bugs you come across; [deleted]; No, showing the public code you had infinite time to write and can’t prove it’s original or more than a graded homework assignment isn’t going to help you. HR and hiring managers got better things to do when faced with 100 applicants in the first 12 hours.\n\nCerts are also worthless but they show you’re interested in a certain niche so that can come across well once you get to the interview. Security is leaned on the job.\n\nYou’re not spreading yourself too thin by any means. If it’s 100-1 odds, best be doing a few hundred applications. Help desk is a starting point and CS grads probably won’t apply to it. Someone posted here that the US government hired then for help desk at $55k. Nice they don’t take visa applicants.\n\nI don’t think you’re doing anything wrong. You just don’t have the best degree and maybe it wasn’t from an elite program. If you get the Capitol One apprenticeship then your resume starts moving to the top of the stack.\n\nI have 12 YoE and 2/3 the work I see is POS $65/hour contract no benefits. I heard McDonalds Corporate doesn’t respond if you ask for more than $135k for any level of experience and they got money to spare.; Do you want to do a unpaid job or find a real job?; Thanks! It's not my passion to do that per se, but it's a next step I'm considering in my job hunt process to find ways to stay occupied and productive at least, after months of earning certs, because I've been out of work for almost 10 months. Even part time jobs with retail/fast food are hesitant to take me when they ask me about my situation because they think I might leave them after 2 months of working there if I get an offer finally.\n\nI'll look into startups however. I don't know of any in my area that isn't government affiliated (and therefore requires a clearance) but if there are more commercial startups, I might have a chance. That looks like a good job board to look into though, I'll check it out!; Handshake is the one my college uses to connect connect students with employers more directly, and they even offer university positions there too, but I've had no luck with that so far. A lot of the more decent entry-level sort of roles or programs are far out of state, or if it's something close by, there's nothing that I'm completely qualified for but I apply to anyway (they require a clearance or a year of relevant job experience I couldn't get, though I do have a lot of relevant skills and knowledge to some of them).\n\nI've been to a few career fairs at my university recently as well, and as much as I tried to build connections and rapport with all kinds of recruiters, I've heard no word back about any interest in an interview even. How is anyone supposed to get into this field?; >Also you really have to commit you cant have both sides most IT jobs want you have certifications in that specific domain or if they see you mainly are software developer they know that you will leave as soon as you can.\n\nThat's true, I just don't know what my strengths are until I can apply myself to an actual job in either field first, and see how I fare. I know I should've done CS instead of IT for this, but I'm just trying to work with what I got and see where I can land. If I do go the IT route, I was thinking of advancing to being a cloud engineer or sysadmin, which appeals to me too. Both appeal to me in their own ways, and I can see myself sticking with one or the other, but my first priority is landing interviews.\n\nI have looked into government jobs that don't require a clearance off the bat, but hearing back from those will take several weeks if not months. I've certainly applied to them, but don't hold any high expectations. Programs like internships don't usually hire for graduates that are out of school from what I've seen, and apprenticeships I'd be more suited for are rarer to come across, but I'm trying.; >No, showing the public code you had infinite time to write and can’t prove it’s original or more than a graded homework assignment isn’t going to help you.\n\nNot all of it was work for a class though; I made a lot of efforts to apply what I learned to making new applications and can prove they were original, but that doesn't seem to be making much of a difference in being competitive.\n\nThe problem with helpdesk jobs is they require an active secret or top secret clearance where I live, and companies don't typically sponsor for that sort of thing, so I'm looking into ones that don't require clearances, but those are much less posted about on the job boards I've seen, and certs are more or less expected for them specifically. I heard applying to startups might give me more success in landing interviews, so I'll check those out at least.; At this point I'm open to either as long as I can gain relevant experience and skills. I might have to check out Catchafire again for remote volunteering work, but that's all I'm able to reliably be given a chance for.; Plenty of remote opportunities. Dozens. Good luck, and you're doing all the right things! Just gotta keep networking, which is kind of a numbers game too. Don't just blind-apply. Reach out to 100 people at companies you are interested in or applied at. 50 will respond. 20 will meet with you. 10 will be helpful. 5 will interview you. 2-3 will offer you. It's a numbers game. Good luck!; do your peers have any success?; How many years of unpaid job do you want to do? I have done like 4-5 of them mainly on GitHub. But they are useless. They said work experience. How do people find it through background check on you?; That's fair, I've applied to hundreds of postings at this point, but got only 3 interviews and no offers in the whole span of time I've been applying.; I've heard a few were able to land some IT or SWE-related positions, but they had more experience before graduating than I did when starting out (I got into this pretty late, and wasn't competitive enough for internships until my last semester when I had actual projects and skills to be marketable).\n\nMost others are either still job hunting and unemployed like me, or work in retail/fast food if they didn't already get passed up for someone who isn't already job hunting outside that industry. I do keep in touch with a lot of them though, and I'm doing a lot of the same things they did/recommend, but I just need to keep applying and seeking opportunities.; I don't hope to be doing it for too long if I get an offer soon, but getting a paid position in this field only has more hoops to jump through. I do make a good effort to apply to paid roles nonetheless, but if I'm not landing any interviews, some experience, on an unpaid job or not in the meantime, is better than nothing.\n\n> How do people find it through background check on you?\n\nWhat did you mean by this? I have my references for previous part time work I've done, as well as volunteering if necessary.; It's just one of those things. It's really hard right now. But if you push through, the gold may just be on the other side of those hills over there. Keep going."

   "Top Comments": "Ok, so I am someone who did experience severe, untreated mental health issues in undergrad and ended up graduating with a shit GPA overall (2.8 ish), but I did get accepted into a master's program at the same (top 20) university before graduating.\n\nIn my case, my first two undergrad years were complete shit, as I had about a 2.1 GPA. However, the last two years were very good for me (3.6 GPA average). I had also been working in a research lab for two years and had my lab professor advocate for me to be accepted into the university's MS program.\n\nI ended up with a 3.86 GPA when I graduated from my MS program. Ended up getting a job lined up before graduation because my employer was willing to ignore the shit undergrad GPA, given that my MS GPA was 3.86. (They actually had a minimum requirement of 3.5 GPA.)\n\nAnyway, the point of my story is to show you that you're not totally fucked despite having a bad GPA right now. You CAN fix this, and you CAN recover from this.\n\nWhat you need to do right now is make sure you get the help you need and get doctors' notes so you can get accommodations from whatever university you plan to finish your degree at. Use those accommodations to help you improve your overall GPA.\n\nAnd yes, schools are usually willing to let you transfer from one to another, and you can usually find one that will accept a 2.4 GPA, but you need to read the school's transfer GPA requirements. I believe most (BUT NOT ALL) schools have higher standards for \"transfer GPAs\". That is, if the bar for entry for a high school student is 3.4 (for example), they may want like a 3.6 transfer GPA. Not every school is like this though, so you'll have to find out about specific Colorado ones.\n\nAnd remember, you also have the opportunity to write a letter explaining your mental health situation to the school you transfer to. Like, definitely leave out the sting operation stuff, but you can explain your struggles _and assure them you are getting help._ But remember to primarily focus on explaining why you want to transfer to _their school_ in specific, and then offer that other stuff to explain how you are actively trying to improve your academic performance through therapy, etc.; I haven't seen too many companies care. Probably around 99% of thousands of applications I've filled out, posted, or seen do not even ask. As for you're GPA and school, there will be a school that will let you in, it may be smaller, but will exist. However, you will have to retake the credits you failed to graduate (at least the ones pertaining to your degree).; >Would a school even let me into their computer science program if they saw that I had a 2.4 gpa at my last school?\n\nProbably not, but why not try taking a leave of absence from your current school?\n\n>Seriously, how much do employers care about gpa?\n\nI'd say 90% of them don't care; do know of some rare cases where offers have been rescinded because of GPA\n\n>Please do not give me doom and gloom about the job market unless it specifically relates to my gpa question\n\nGet this: `I accidentally sold alcohol to a minor` off your record. That's way more important than any GPA stuff; Thanks man, I really appreciate the response. I think that I will try medicine now. My therapist has been gently pushing me in that direction and I haven’t wanted to. But now it might be a necessity I am realizing.; Thank you for the response.; Thanks for the response. And I did, I am on diversion. So me freaking out was for nothing. I want to transfer schools because I am so tired of living in Kansas I hate it here and I am ready to get out. None of the other schools in Kansas interest me at all either.; No problem!\n\nI take meds, and honestly, being on the right ones have helped me a ton. Just make sure you understand side effects going into it, as some psychiatric meds can cause bad sedation (like remeron for depression). That sedation can then make it difficult to get work done if you're sleeping 12-16 hrs a day. But the good news is that not every psych med is sedating, so just make sure to ask for something non-sedating first. Plenty of non-sedating options."

   "Title": "Coding Questions.. why are they used and do you use them in your work?",
   "Top Comments": ">why do companies use them?\n\nFilter out false positives.\n\nIf you have 20 candidates and 5 of them are \"acceptable\" for the role, a coding test might filter out the 15 \"unacceptable\" candidates plus 3 \"acceptable\" candidates. You're left with 2 \"acceptable\" candidates to choose from.; >why do these damned leetcode interview questions scare me so much? Better yet, why do companies use them?\n\nYou'd be surprised how many candidates sound great on paper, but fall apart once they're asked to do basic things. You also need to realize that hiring is expensive, and replacing a bad hire is even more expensive, and worse in other countries where it's hard to remove an employee. So hiring the right person is extremely important.\n\nRight now there really isn't a single great way to validate someone's capabilities.\n\n* People can lie on their resume. It's even talked about here where people say that it's okay to lie on your resume if it helps you\n* People can study for interviews to say the right thing for common questions, but don't really know what it means in real-life application. They can talk the talk, but not walk the walk\n\nSo basically just trusting someone's word is a risk. Some people do it, and it can work out. But it is a risk. So many companies in the industry have turned to what other industries do: vet someone's capabilities in the interview phase\n\nI've been hiring engineers for over a decade. I've absolutely seen people that have a good resume who had years of experience but when pressed had no idea about fundamental things like how to build an API, how to process a CSV, etc. Or even if they did, some failed even moderate level things like why it would be bad to load a 2GB text file into memory, etc. despite being a \"senior level engineer.\"\n\nCommon approaches for validating people I've seen are:\n\n* Leetcode style where you are given a highly isolated problem and you solve it. Usually this is done within the confines of an interview. It has the benefit of being fast enough where it's not a time sink for everyone involved. Hard part is, the majority of the time it has nothing to do with what you do every day for most people. You also need to find something complicated but not too complicated, and novel enough to get what you want out of it\n* Take-home exercise. This is usually bigger in scope, and requires more work on everyone, especially the candidate. It has the benefit of usually being closer to what you'd do every day at that job, and you use your own comfortable working environment. But it's also largely abused and can require far too much time on the candidate. I've been asked to build something as a take-home where the company said \"this will take you 3 weeks\", which was insane. I've personally done some that took me a week. The ideal spot is 2-3 hours or so, but even then that's a lot of time. And you still need to find a way to do this where you're not abusing someone for free work, and it's meaningful.\n* Walk through a project and do a deep dive in it. I've rarely seen this, but we're trying it at our job. It's also hard due to NDAs, etc. and not everyone has personal projects to walk through.\n\nOur company's approach is to ask the candidate their preference and go from there.\n\n>do you have any tips on how to feel more confident when tackling these leetcode-style\n\nFor feeling more confident in doing leetcode? Just practice, and practice a lot. Once you do it for a while you start to develop that skill, and it is a specific skill, and you start to see patterns.; You should know the Builder Pattern, that's encountered in day to day coding.; the math checks out, just sucks for people who get really nervous at the whiteboard; Some kinds of day-to-day coding.; what kind of coding?\n\nIn my experience with APIs you're collecting data from a webform, passing it through JSON, then an API and eventually into a SQL db. In none of those layers are you constructing a new object. \n\nConversely you might be working on an existing dataset and need to present it to the user for display, in that case you're just essentially binding properties to a UI.; You can use a builder to construct clients and requests to hit the apis for example https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html#get-started-code.; Not sure about frontend, but backend. It might depend on what your backend is written in. I hadn’t considered that in my reply. Java and C#.; Hmm, to me that seems more like populating an object's properties before using it, not so much implementation of the Builder. Maybe I'm not seeing it :/; Do you have a code example?; https://blog.stackademic.com/builder-pattern-in-spring-boot-6ed7b0e57e1f\n\nYou can also sometimes see it in JSON constructions.; There are even libraries just to make builders. \nhttps://www.baeldung.com/java-builder-pattern-freebuilder; Hmm that definitely is an example. Though TBH I've never used it because I usually use AutoMapper services or Entity Framework in C#. Plus, often my dtos have like 20 properties and making 40 getters and setters seems painfully bloated.; I'm currently working in Java, can't really recall a case of it for C# (my last workplace). There are definitely builder classes like StrinpgBuilder but they don't use the Builder Pattern. So maybe it's a weird question to be asked in C# in which case I'd probe like you have done and see where that occurs in their codebase. But maybe like asking leetcode it's not so much about coding proficiency than a mean to reduce the applicant pool."

I complained to our boss that I was struggling to find time since he left so early, and he said \"look it's not like I can do anything about it, just try to find him when he's here\". This \"bully\" has no power, HR has no power, just laugh at her and keep doing what you're doing while chilling with the people at your work you actually like. And if you don't like anyone just take long lunches, get there/log in late, leave early, and do the bare minimum and enjoy your full paycheck with no downside.; Hahah sounds like a toxic moron.

I just took a PT job as a phone interviewer to get my foot in the door with hopes of transitioning into SWE next year with the company, but the pay is actually terrible (13.5/hr). Gonna keep looking ofc but man does this feel rough.\n\nEdit: University of Washington, Seattle.; Graduated a week ago. Accepted a job offer in February. Start June 3rd.; UK, 1yoe with masters in mathematics, been a programmer for 12 years, 9 year long portfolio of real projects. Haven't gotten past the first stage of interviews in 18 months. Never made more than minimum wage.; I got a qa job in 2023 last year after an internship.; I'm right at 1y 11months and have a final interview scheduled for next Tuesday. I'll let you know how it goes in a week.; [deleted]; Me. My parents have many industry connections so I sent my resume to their friends/colleagues. That's how I got my job. I still had to interview (leetcode, system design, behavioral, etc.), wasn't given an offer just like that because of the connections/referrals. \n\nAsk your family and friends if they know anyone hiring and send your resume to them. It may work out for you too. And keep applying online. Big companies and small. Be open to relocation. Good luck; I would encourage people on this post to mention if they are located in the US, the state they are on, and if they need a visa.\n\nIs not the same having trouble finding a job in DC than in IN. Same goes for work authorization; 143, i counted.; 0yoe still in school.  Was more of a promotion/transfer.  The other hires have decades more experience.; I graduated from Rutgers in January 2024, got a sweet 6-figure swe job in a big bank started Feb 2024; Graduating in May and I have a job lined up as a Software Developer; In twenty twenty-four, with a sigh,  \nA grad from the tech world did try,  \nBut software skills lacked,  \nSo job hunts were stacked,  \nNow coding dreams seem to fly high.; Got a job, job got rescinded, got another job, same thing, finally started a new job a year after graduating that's 20x better than the last 2 jobs, so there's a silver lining.; Laid off in October with just under 2 yoe, secured a role in December. I got very lucky.; I got one\n\nI went to a small school."

   "Top Comments": ">Any idea why I am not getting any call backs. When I applied in 2021, my resume was way worse than this yet I got 5 interviews the first week.\n\nThe market has become much worse than it was back then.; You're not alone here. We're in the worst market the industry has seen since the 08' crash.\n\nDo what you can to get through this. You're not necessarily doing anything wrong. It's just a hard time for everyone who is on the market right now.; I’d drop the blurb about your school’s ranking. It’s a yellow flag when a candidate goes out of their way to highlight something like this. \n\nAnyone who cares about where you went to undergrad will know about CMU.; Remote jobs are extremely competitive now. Since 2021 the number of RTO jobs is very high and people are willing to take significant pay cuts to work for few remaining fully remote positions.; I wish that your resume was a more clear about what kind of job that you are looking for.  It seems like backend (which would mean that front end would not consider you).  But, still, it makes the hiring manager guess and leaves them unsure.\n\nI feel that you have too many bullet points for each of your work experiences.  I feel that it buries what the points that you really want to get across and that, in the hiring manager's mind, they just abbreviate it to \"did a lot of stuff\".\n\nSo to summarize your resume: \"I'm probably looking for a backend engineer job, I've had 2 jobs were I did a bunch of stuff in each one, some of which was coding, and I have an education.\"  I'd prefer that your resume leave more specifics in my mind.; Your resume and experience look great. Some points:\n\n1) I would add more specific technology and programming languages to your descriptions because it sounds like a lot of talking and not enough programming. For example, describe what your SaaS tech stack is in your first job.\n\n2) I would put CMU education at the top of your Education section and frankly remove the Alchemist Accelerator or put it under CMU. CMU is more eyecatching and Alchemist Accelerator sounds like a bootcamp even though it's an accelerator. I've personally never heard of them, I've only worked at a YC startup once.\n\n3) Bluntly, it's going to be hard to find a job the more pregnant you get, especially at a startup. No one will want to hire you and then see you gone for multiple months. It sucks but that's just the reality especially if you're targeting startups, because they can't afford to pay someone who isn't there.\n\n4) Working from Canada and expecting a remote job in the US, if that's what you're doing, is going to be really tough. This is the worst job environment since the DotCom bust. I wouldn't expect much at all for a while.; Do you need sponsorship?; I would recommend keeping the resume a little lighter. The first human to see it will be a recruiter, so imagine trying to explain any of this to them. They're trying to scan quickly for key words. I feel like a lot of your details are things you can save for an interview with a hiring manager to talk about example projects. \n\nI know the standard Internet resume advice says you must include hard numbers (improved x by y percent). But I don't think they make sense in this field and they're probably mostly made up. I decided to skip those on my resume. I'm not like a major expert or anything, but I have interviews at a couple big companies this week.\n\nAlso keep it short. Details and projects from school get less relevant overtime.\n\nEdit: fixed typo; If you are in the U.S., it is very illegal to not hire someone because they are pregnant or because they might become pregnant. And if part of their decision to lay you off was because you were pregnant, oh man…\n\nhttps://www.eeoc.gov/fact-sheet-recent-eeoc-pregnancy-discrimination-litigation; I think that your resume is quite hard to read.\nTry to improve brevity and contrary to what people will tell you, it's not all about numbers. Sure, use numbers to beat ATS, but don't be focused only on that. Pay attention to fonts. Put something that stands out in your CV.; If you want more opportunities with jobs in the US, be prepared to relocate.\n\nRemote positions are now mostly reserved for cheap offshore labor, or senior engineers with several years of experience.; Things suck really bad right now. It's probably not you.; Unfortunately it’s a crap market. I’ve been applying since 2022, and received 3x FAANG offers that were rescinded before starting. I was then laid off in early 2023, was fortunate to immediately find a job but at a 30% haircut. I took it thinking I’d just find another job at my old salary and switch. A year later and at least another 200 applications and still nothing. Good luck out there friend.; Holy this resume is incredible if you having trouble with this I'm soo cooked; No one’s getting that much callbacks. Ive even been referred by friends in some companies and still ghosted; You're in Montreal according to the resume but your recent jobs are in San Francisco.    \n\n\n Are you job searching in the US or Canada? Are you seeking a job in Montreal? Are you on a visa, or do you need one?  This should be included in your post!   \n\n\nAlso, it's not clear why Arabic and Spanish are listed on your resume. Assuming you're in Notth America. \n\n\n This is quite confusing. If you're searching in Canada, you're going to run into the 'no Canadian experience ' issue. If you're searching in the US, employers are probably binning your resume when they see Montreal at the top. The lack of clarity is probably a factor.; The market is very bad.; Not a single person pointed out the obvious: your resume is too long, limit it to one page. This sub is truly pointless.; Not to get too personal but how far along are you ok your pregnancy term?\n\nI would talk to someone professional i.e lawyer about your options. This can be seen as good case.; I see a lot of \"we\" instead of \"I\".\n\nYou talk about how you CONTRIBUTED TO something that achieved XYZ. But that's not _your_ work. I want to know the impact of _your_ specific work, not your _team's_ work. Tell me about _you_, not _them._\n\nObviously teamwork is important, but being a team player doesn't mean much to me if you cannot show me that you are capable of being a high achiever on your own.\n\nAs an example, let's pretend you and I are entering a baking competition. We decide to bake a chocolate cake. I have no fucking clue what I am doing, so I just grab a random bag of cocoa powder and say, \"here, use this.\" Now, let's say you win the competition after baking the cake. I can technically say that I CONTRIBUTED TO your win because I did, after all, pick out the bag of cocoa powder that you used, but did I _actually_ do anything impactful? Nope."

   "Title": "Lying about my location for work?",
   "Top Comments": "I've seen people say that on this subreddit, but in my opinion in *most* cases (maybe not all) that's not what's happening. They're just not getting selected because of their resume/interviewing ability. People love to look for anything they can blame that's out of their control to make them feel better, and blaming your location is an easier pill to swallow than acknowledging it's your resume.\n\nIn my personal experience, I've had no trouble both relocating (onsite/hybrid) for a job located across the country, and joining a remote company that's located >1000 miles away. I've done the former twice, and the latter once. I never lied about my location. Companies were very adamant with me about hiring the right person, regardless of location.\n\nThey're not going to pick the mediocre candidate that's nearby, and pass over the preferred candidate just because they live across the country. Rarely are companies ever in a situation where they have 2 exactly identical candidates, but the only difference is one lives near an office, and the other doesn't, so they use location as a tiebreaker.\n\nThe problem with lying is that can easily put yourself in a situation where you *do* get a callback, but you would've gotten that callback even if you were honest. Now whenever the truth comes out, *you lied.* Lying is one of the biggest possible red flags for a company. That could very easily get an offer rescinded if you announced \"jk, I'm actually living in Michigan lol'.; The reason companies tend to still hire locally after going remote is because all their employees networks are still local. I’ve been remote for over half my career at this point and if you asked me to list every dev I know, most live in the same state as I do. \n\nLying is a dumb idea because they will find out before you get hired and it will be awkward. \n\nAlso, a lot of remote companies don’t have everything they need to have employees in every state, so that may be another reason.; Even if you successfully lie your way to onboarding the whole thing is going to fall apart when you have to give your address to HR.; One thing I discovered after moving to the west coast but continuing to work for an east coast based company is that time zones matter a LOT.  These jerks keep scheduling 6AM meetings.; A few thoughts. First, if you're lying about your permanent address while receiving income, you're probably committing criminal tax fraud. Don't do that.\n\nIf you're lying only for the sake of getting an interview, you run the risk of getting an offer for local work somewhere you don't actually live. Obviously, you'd have to move, but that might raise suspicions and you'd probably be completely ineligible for any kind of moving bonus. If they found out, your employer might be annoyed that you lied, which is dumb because the only thing they really care about is whether you're willing to relocate or not.; Yes. And there is a bias for it. I got a google voice number for a location I wanted to move to and showed my address as being a few blocks away. ; I'm in the Bay Area and managed to interview and get offers for Seattle, Chicago, and parts of East Coast for hybrid and remote roles. Location is probably one of those last factors where if you and another candidate are equal valuation.; if it's a remote role then no your location doesn't really matter assuming that:\n  \n1. location is not a problem for visas\n  \n2. location is not a problem for timezone differences; It was suggested to open a PO box there lol.; That's a company culture issue, not a timezone issue. Sure the timezone is literally what shines a light on the issue, but it's the company's fault for having a culture that doesn't respect everyone's time.\n\nMy current company is in MT, and I'm in ET. Everybody makes it a point to not schedule meetings after my working hours (5pm for me, so 3pm for them), and that we don't schedule meetings before their working hours (9am for them, so 11am for me).\n\nThe company before that had offices on both coasts. Same deal. We all made it a point to respect each others time and only schedule meetings during core working hours.\n\nBe the change you want to see. Maybe try and start a conversation with your team to establish working agreements that highlight what \"core working hours\" are, and get it on-paper that requierd meetings shouldn't be scheduled outside of them. Making you work at 6am isn't reasonable. How would they react if you scheduled a meeting at 8pm their time?; Location *is* a problem for taxes and legal jurisdictions ; it absolutely does matter, both to the IRS and any applicable local state tax board.\n\nLying about that is a crime.; If you put on your official documents that you live in a PO box, you've moved beyond lying and entered into fraud.; I'm not a tax expert or a lawyer, but you could get yourself into trouble pretty quickly tax wise. Especially if the company only operates in a few states and you're not located in one of them.; Your I9 form asks for your permanent address, not a mailing address.; And what happens when you log into your work computer? They can see where you are and Teams will have your timezone under your profile. \n\n\nAnd before you decide you've got it all figured out and you'll just use a VPnN, you should know most companies use their own VPNs so remote workers can access the company intranet, so you can't use your own to make it look like you're somewhere else ; Agreed, but it’s the kind of culture thing you don’t always know about when starting a new job, so worth being aware of.   (In my case the company culture shifted a lot not so long after I moved); well ok I assumed that OP <-> employer is okay with taxes stuff too; Yeah, but OP doesn't seem like they're planning on being upfront about where they'll be working from, which means the company and OP won't be paying the taxes they should be. "

This question misses the entire point of employment: To pay the bills.\n\nTry being employed for a month and if you don't like it, you can receive your promotion to being unemployed and revert to $0/year.\n\nYes, always look for a better job.; Take the job.

If you can take a job that writes code, things will likely turn around.; If you’re not afraid of getting blacklisted by this company you can just accept the offer and continue to job search; Worst case scenario, try it out for a couple months while applying to other positions.  If you find something at like 50k better, I would hop ship, otherwise stay and suffer for the experience.  People are downplaying how big experience is.  Every second in a gap is a question for another recruiter.  Don't make a recruiter question you.  Stay employed as much as possible, don't take breaks for your ego.  This is one of the reasons people from FAANGs are hurting right now.  Everyone wants a 4 month vacation after they get laid off.; For sure!; I was really hoping that the market wasn't actually as bad as it seemed, and I was just doing it wrong tbh. :/\n\nI would really like it to be $80k, that was my floor. It's $70k which is still >$0 for sure.; Yeah, it is insane how much different it is.\n\nAt the start, I was seeing all of these openings, and they just never panned out. Except the super sketchy ones that wanted to pay me in crypto... \n\nI would rather not commit tax fraud tbh.; I agree with you, I want to get a job that isn't screwing me out of a better option. \n\nI have been doing an awful lot to try and find a job, and this was in a grey area for me bc I am not experienced in navigating the job market yet.\n\nUp until my last position, I have only ever had minimum wage labor or customer service jobs, so I thought to ask where people are a bit more experienced than I am. \n\nIf taking a job significantly below what I was expecting to make would be a really stupid idea, I want to know. \n\nIf taking any job at all that is still in my field is the best that I can expect, I want to know. \n\nIt seems like the latter is more applicable than I was aware of, so if I get a second interview, I'm definitely snagging it while I keep looking. \n\nI appreciate that between my Severance and unemployment, I am not at threat of homelessness, and not everyone has that luxury."

Started an MS, got an internship, got a full time offer and then dropped out.; This field is so cooked; Market isn't great, I support biding your time getting a master's degree. You should know a lot of internships are for undergrad only though. Still, my skip manager gives preference to masters & PhD candidates.; I think you'd need to factor in:\n\n* Opportunity cost of salary (depends what you make now) and not necessarily having a job after an internship.\n* Cost of tuition.\n* Possible cost of health insurance (depends whether you get it now).\n\nFor me, it's not worth it. My MS is part-time, I work a full-time job at six figures, and I found a small place willing to do a cheap, part-time internship.; I’m having this same problem.

Decided to start my masters, starting next month but I am nervous that it will still be a waste of time and end up in the same position but in more debt lmao. Good luck to you idk what to do either. :(; More like start a masters degree. Get an internship. Secure job.

After years of working and interviewing people, I've found that the people with the most certs perform the worst and know the least. At this point, I actually don't care if someone has any certifications and I tend to lean toward the people with less. \n\nAnyway...\n\nIf you must get a certification, get one that isn't some generic \"web dev\" type. Find a domain/stack you like and follow their path such as AWS, ElasticSearch, Salesforce, RedHat, etc.; Programming certs are worthless but technology certs can have some value. I’d pick up some cloud certs for whatever provider your company uses (aws, azure, gcp).; The only one matters is funny enough a System Admin cert, not a dev cert.\n\nIf you want to work in cleared space (Top Secret), for a lot of programs you need a Security+. Nearly completely useless for a developer, yet the government insists on it.\n\nGet a CS degree, TS clearance, Security+ and you’ll never be out of work.\n\n\nBeyond that, I’m not sure of any cert that provides significant value.; They are all money making scams by the people who own the technology. No one cares about your GitHub either. I just assume it’s copy pasted from your graded homework or plagiarized or I don’t have an hour to review when 100 other people apply.\n\nYou’re some major contributor to some major project…that’s different. Some recruiters will reach out to you.\n\nI have an engineering degree and work in CS. Let me tell you about exam from that world.\n\nThe actual legit FE exam for engineering is administered by each state’s board of engineers, who work independently of their real jobs. They care about pass rates being too high or low. You can’t memorize your way and pass. That would be bad for the state. No one involved is there to profit.\n\nEngineers who are negligent on the job or commit serious crimes face the board. What cert has a team to do that? They only exist for money.\n\nAlso, your college transcript has to be reviewed by the state board before you can even take the exam. The knowledge needed to pass takes 4-5 years to learn and if your program wasn’t ABET, you get denied.\n\nCS certs have been scams since they existed. If one college course is 45 hours of lectures and 90 hours of homework, how is that deserving of a title after your name?\n\nCert is less work than that and cheating is always a problem. You enable cheating on the FE exam, it’s criminal activity by comparison.\n\nAlso, there are no certs in engineering. We all know they’re bs. People want to get into CS cause it seems easy and sexy (AI/ML!) and high paying but they don’t have the time or money or ability or patience for CS or related degree. \n\nSo they want to shortcut the process. You’re in low paying and easy web dev that always cared less about degrees….cause it’s easy and low paying.\n\nI guess you don’t have a degree either and it doesn’t seem real how CS could be full of scams. **CS is like the most scam-ridden industry after professional wrestling.** I’m not even touching visa fraud.\n\nI can’t believe I wrote all that. Sorry was long.; If you absolutely have to do some certs, then maybe go get some AWS certs. Not like it is going to matter much. Def no substitute for a CS degree. But it is better than nothing.\n\nAlso, I have seen some people who were not hard core developers go get some Agile certifications. Don't think that will help any in your sw development.

Because there’s a third party that vouched for you. If you can get someone to vouch for you elsewhere it will work too.; When folks say that certs don’t matter they are usually parroting wiser folks who mean to say, “a cert is a supplement”\n\nSo pick something that you’d like to do. Cuz unless you continue with it, it won’t matter.

And then another colleague from another department who wants to switch to dev work but had no programming experience, doesn't want to self learn and wants to take trainings that will give certificates.\n\n\nAfter working with those kind of devs, i had been careful when interviewing candidates who are super focused on their certs during interview.; The reason for this could be that the one who is equipped with skills doesn't find much time and interest in doing certification and the one who probably has lesser skills tries to compensate for it with certification.\nSecondly, whenever we send any tech proposal to a service based company they advertise it with the x number of people with  this (x,y,z) certification.

There would be other elements to break the tie - including soft skills, personality, compensation requirements, etc... If those are truly identical between two candidates then just kill me, because we'd be living in a simulation. \n\nThe only time I've seen certifications \"matter\" for an otherwise truly qualified candidate were for \"implementation partners\" that want to market their services with things like, \"we have 100 certified <x> experts on staff\". At which point, your organization lacks integrity and values quantity over quality - they aren't worth working for in my opinion.; That wasn't my experience in college at all.  I majored in math, but took a lot of CS classes, and there was heavy emphasis on problem solving and developing a solid conceptual understanding of the theory behind various concepts in computing.  I spent a good chunk of my senior year writing a thesis on recent research on data structures and algorithms (compressed suffix arrays).\n\nThat was very different than my experience with AWS Cloud certifications.  Those were mostly about memorizing a list of features of each service, and learning how to identify keywords on the cert exams.  Since the certification exams have lots of problems, none of them require deep problem solving skills."

   "Title": "Someone please explain to me how can someone that knows nothing about what you’re doing be your manager?",
   "Top Comments": "Unfortunately there are a lot of bad managers out there and few good ones\n\nA big reason is that communicating technical issues to a non-technical manager is hard. I see lots of developers that describe all of the things they've done to investigate or resolve an issue, none of which is understandable for a non-technical manager. So all the manager hears is \"this person doesn't know what they're doing\"\n\nNon-technical people require a different way of communicating. You can't just tell them \"Oh, the API of product Y didn't match the specification, so I had to build a workaround, but that isn't compatible with the libraries we are using\", as they won't understand any of that. Yet this is how a lot of developers communicate during a status update. Instead you have to tell them \"the people of product Y delivered the wrong documents, so now I have to spend a few days extra to make it all work. It's not great, but it's probably faster to do it ourselves\"; I can't speak for all companies, but it isn't really the manager's job to \"solve\" an issue or problem. From what I've seen, it's typically the senior devs or leads that come up with the solutions. Management just relays the project information to the team and helps assign the work.\n\nI had a manager who did understand the technical side, but he was not involved in any of the problem solving unless it was something severely delayed. I don't think you're wrong in your framing of managers as slave drivers, but that's what the business wants.; I honestly have had bad technical managers and excellent non-technical ones. The best manager I had was non-technical. I miss him very much, but the company we worked at pissed him off too much.\n\nSo I personally don’t tie my assessment of a manger to whether they are technical or not. A lot of it depends on their willingness to understand and work with you; if they feel they are above you and know better, they won’t be a good manager regardless of their technical capabilities.\n\nETA: my current manager behaves like you describe a non-technical manager and he was a C# dev in the past I believe.; A good manager is there for *organization* problems.\n\nAre there resources you need and aren't getting?  Is there something the higher-ups need to be aware of?  Is someone else failing to do something?  Do you need more time to finish a task?\n\nIt's your sorry butt that's there for the technical ones.; I think there are some non-technical managers who can do a good job, but in order for that to work, they need to:\n\nA.) Be good with people. Likeable people are easier to rally behind.\n\nB.) Not try to drive technical discussions, while also knowing when to reign things in if scope increases too much.\n\nC.) Being open to feedback and attempt to understand the technical discussions at a surface level, even if that's just asking for an ELI5.\n\nA good manager should be able to advocate for you, and also keep upper management BS from derailing you as much as possible. While the technical expertise is nice and appreciated, I care about that less than having someone who open with communication and sensible. Having a manager who doesn't advocate for you when review time comes around is one of the most disheartening parts of the job.; The skillet required for a manager is very different compared to a software engineer. \n\nHaving technical skills will help them communicate better with the engineers but good managers will still be able to work around their technical limitations.\n\nThey need to balance the team morale and business expectations and also keep the employees happy within the business limitations. Easier said than done when business wants the new initiative completed by yesterday.\n\nManagers who suck at their job are the ones who can't manage the business expectations and burn out everyone on the team.; That's a false dichotomy.\n\nI have had horrible technical managers, I have had amazing non tech managers ( from MBAs, to industrial engineers, to psychologist).\n\nOf course,your experience is not uncommon, especially when companies want to save one head and conflagrate the senior dev role and the team/project manager role ( as mentioned in other comments).; Manager doesn’t need to know how to code, they need to know how to manage projects, people, and timelines. Good managers will listen to their engineers/reports; Back in the 80s, they needed a degree that all the coked out trust fund babies could easily receive that they could use to make sure that their kids wouldn't have to actually work but could make a living. \n\nSo the MBA became super popular. But in order to justify this huge rash of people with no actual skills being given the largest salaries in every business, a huge amount of money was spent convincing people that Managers don't have to know anything about the product or industry because \"people are people no matter what they are doing and you're going to be managing people\".\n\nYou're seeing the results of 40 years of cocaine fueled justifications.; >These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. They’re there to force devs to give themselves deadlines and burn themselves out.\n\nLmao it's really not that serious. Their job is to manage communication, timelines, tasks, resources, deliverables, etc. - you don't need intimate technical knowledge of the project to manage resources and timelines. Project & people managing is a whole set of skills on their own.\n\nIt just sounds like you not only don't understand their role but don't respect it.; > These are roles to whip the employees to work harder, slaves overlooking other slaves. \n\n\nAlright, take a breath. I get what you're going for, but let's dial back the analogy a bit. \n\n\nGood managers are shit umbrellas - they deal with all the shit coming from above and handle it so it doesn't trickle to you. They don't *have* to be technical. Does it help? You bet. Is it strictly required to be good? Genuinely, absolutely not. \n\n\nA talk I really enjoyed broke managers down into three archetypes: Visionaries have the big picture in mind for the business and can keep the teams' work on track for it. Facilitators can get you time and resources to complete your work. Cheerleaders advocate for you and your teams' project successes and career goals and will find ways to ensure you are motivated to continue. \n\n\nOf course all three in one is great, but obviously some are better at some of these than others. All to say, in my experience, I've had better luck with managers who didn't have the same technical chops I did but could absolutely get *their* boss off of *my* nuts so I could work.; My company does a sorta matrix approach to management, we mostly do contract work so people will shift around between projects based on specializations and current project needs, managers are generally leading or managing projects, but your people manager might not be leading the project you are on, in fact for the past 5 years my manager (which has changed twice in that time) was not involved in my projects.  My last manager literally didn’t know what I was working on, not in a day to day sense but he didn’t even know what project I was on.\n\nTo be fair though, I don’t really need a manager, and quite a few of us are in the same boat.  My manager exists to sign my time sheet and deal with request I have like a new computer.  We do some kinda yearly review stuff, but it’s mostly going through the motions.  There would be more if I were more junior or seeking a role growth, becoming a manager or something, but I am happy with my responsibilities and my growth is all technical skills (I work in robotics so theres a lot of room for technical skill growth); I am a non-manager writing software but have an MBA. I was taught in business school that the value of technical knowledge decreases as you get farther away from the technical aspects of the business, and understanding of \"strategy\" and \"business value\" become more important. There is a concept in business that leadership, management, and technical ability are all independent from each other. In my experience, this is not very accurate. There is something to be said for managers/leadership not being bogged down by technical details so they can focus on strategy and business needs, but management that doesn't understand the technology has no way to properly manage technical projects. \n\nThat being said. A manager does not need to be a better technician than their subordinates (in fact, if they are, then they are probably being wasted on management). Their job is not to solve technical issues or write code, that is closer to what a senior/principal engineer would do. Management's job is to plan technical projects, remove obstacles for their team, keep track of quality and deadlines, and keep the team happy. You cannot plan technical projects, track quality, and manage deadlines realistically without some technical knowledge, but being really good at writing software doesn't make you good at doing those other things either.; Because they are not there to do technical work. They are there to manage the team. Handle the product management . Incorporate it into other parts of the business.   \n\n\nThey are there to help everyone else deal with prima Donnas like you ; I have a manager who instead of helping me focus on my tasks, brings me problems and rumors to solve. Having a competent manager is huge in productivity. Usually they reach out to other departments, get requirements and required information, push BAs to get requirements to meet a deadline, etc.; I am also against software managers being from completely different field but how can you describe a good or bad manager? A manager jumping and solving a technical issue is too much and I feel like when managers have bad work life balance they definitely dont want their team to have a good one. Solving a technical issue should be architects or team lead issue if there is a single manager for all i am sure the team also has a bad wlb. I am sure companies now forcing workers towards bad wlb cutting the number of engineers no they are not laying off the excess they hired during pandemic this is your assumption; Generally if a company has non technical managers they will also have a tech lead IC role to drive the technical conversations. If you don’t have that I can see how it would be frustrating for you. \n\nEven if the manager is non technical though, they should still be involved enough day to day to understand the work and stack at a high level and take part in discussions. I’d call it “technically fluent”. I do see a lot of non technical managers just withdraw from the day to day which completely disconnects them from the team and I don’t see how you could be an effective manager without knowing what is going on.; There aren't enough people who are good at both to go around, and the opposite (someone who is good at tech but bad at managing a team) is far more crippling, to the point I'd rather the team self manage.; Nepotism, cronyism, favoritism, and managers always fall up. There's just nothing we can do, we're trapped in this system to enrich someone's son.; I'm in IT not CS so maybe that's enough to make it so my opinion has no relevance to you, but I completely disagree. \n\nIt is not the job of your manager to do the job. It is the job of your manager to make sure that you can do your job. \n\nI've had great non technical managers. They understand that their role is to block us from bullshit and find a way to move us forward when we're stuck. \n\nI would posit that the bad managers you've worked with aren't bad because they're not technical. They're just bad managers."

That's life.\n\nEdit. Stick it out. Keep looking. Put up with what you don't like while you keep looking.; Had a similar experience recently.

Got two offers a week later, one which I accepted but decided to take a month off before starting. 1 mo in now,  new company is amazing, it was a good decision. \n\nThis was in december last year.; Early on in my career I had a job for 1 week, and a job for 6 weeks. The 1 week was a place that threw me right in the fire and barely anyone had time to help me adjust to any of their systems.

I well certainly not do anything hasty but should a better opportunity come along I think I will take it.; Fair enough.  I have had a lot of success with the job market.; The economy isn’t bad, but the job economy is.

No response from the MODS when I messaged them a couple days ago.; [deleted]; Asking for a second opinion - I inherited my childhood home in another state and plan to move back home. There's just like logistics involved like cleaning some stuff out, wrapping up finals, etc. The house is in my name. I plan on applying for jobs local to the area - is it unethical to put that address on my application/resume? I don't want anyone to be concerned about having to pay for relocation when I had already planned to relocate anyway. Like if I got a job I could be there as early as this weekend, but I had just planned on taking 3-6 months otherwise to like clean and make some changes to the house.; Struggling to decide between comp sci or comp engineering, I completed my associates in a software engineering program but honestly coding was never really the main draw for me, I'm more interested in architecture and design rather than software development. Is there really a noticeable difference between the different career paths for these degrees?; Looking for a career change(27,Bsc Mech,Int) to data engineering.MSU MSDS admit - Career Advice Needed!\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI recently got accepted into the MSU Master's in Data Science program My background is in supply chain/ procurement for an ev company(4 years in my home country), and I recently learnt python.I am looking to transition mainly for the good pay.\n\nGiven my limited experience, I'm hoping to get some advice on what kind of data engineering jobs I should target after graduation.\n\nAre there specific entry-level roles that should focus on?\n\n*Will I have better prospects if I choose any other masters?; I’m a self-taught SWE with 8 years of experience. My strongest language is Python, by far, and I’m very comfortable coding in it. However, I think my career has stalled a bit because my skill set hasn’t really expanded much beyond that. My last two jobs were at companies that made extensive use of AWS, but I had never really used it at those jobs. Most of my work was just writing application code without touching AWS. I’ve taken some basic coursework on AWS and GCP but I have no real workplace experience working with them, and I think that may be hindering my career prospects a bit at this point.\n\nIs there any way I can reach a similar level of proficiency with AWS (and other platforms like Azure and GCP) outside of a professional environment. I’ve been taking coursework, including official coursework at AWS and GCP, but in my experience, coursework only provides a very surface-level understanding of whatever it is one is trying to learn. For example, I didn’t get to where I am in Python by taking courses and tutorials. I did it by actually building things.\n\nI’m currently job hunting so it’s not like I have a 9-5 to keep me busy right now. Is there any way I upskill to get to the level of experience and proficiency in AWS/GCP/Azure that I would normally get from a regular job?\n\nI’ve heard some people say that side projects are a good way to do this, but what would/should I work on that would actually help me get proficient? Would side projects actually be a good way to upskill? Would they improve my job prospects?\n\nI've done some labs through the official AWS and GCP courses as well as some from ACloudGuru, but those seem very...inadequate. They basically just walk you through how to do everything. IMO, labs don't really help you much. I'm more interested in actual projects. Ideally, it'd be cool if someone could assign me something to build and just let me build it from scratch, learning everything on my own.; I’m a software dev with 8 months exp so far. 3 months in one role as a quality engineer, felt like DevOpsy, second was low code for 3 months and now working through legacy php that will rewrite with MERN stack \n\nWould love to have a remote dev job. Only good thing is my office job is a bus away \n\nAny advice for someone like me in the UK? I’m 29 and yeah honestly, just want a digital nomad life of sorts; Should I take a job as a \"customer analyst\" while Im in school for CS? The job said to be faniliar with help desk technologies, javascript, html, and SQL. Sounds like a step in the right direction? Or not? I quit working as a scientist esrlier this year bc I hated it and wanted more time to focus on school. Any advice?; Is the Google UX Design Certificate worth it for a mostly backend developer looking to move into frontend roles that have proper design teams?\n\nI am hoping to move from a mostly backend role into a frontend role that has to interact with design teams. Basically I'm hoping to land a frontend role where the design matters, like a user-facing website. Eventually, I would like to move into something like a UX developer role which actually takes part in the UX design process while still being (at least partially) a programming job.\n\nMy background includes 5 years experience with both backend and frontend work, but is heavily skewed towards the backend. I am working on this also by trying to position myself for any frontend work that comes up, but that's a work-in-progress for sure.\n\nWithout a *lot* of frontend work to put on a resume, I'm looking for alternative ways to signal that I am motivated and capable of working in these kinds of roles. I was hoping that going through the UX Design certificate (on Coursera), and implementing the design projects that I would have to create as part of the program, would give me a resume filler and also some interesting projects to add to my portfolio site. My question is, given my background would this be worth my time, or is there a better way to signal that I am a strong candidate for the roles I'm going for?; Can I apply to internships and new grad roles at the same company this upcoming fall? And is it advisable in my position?\n\nI’m supposed to graduate next spring, but I don’t have any internship experience. I’m considering delaying my graduation to next fall and applying to both types of roles.; Someone with a bit of experience may have an edge if you have 0 experience. But it isn't a guarantee that you'll be rejected because of that alone. I've interviewed plenty of people who had a bit of experience and we passed on them simply because they weren't what we were looking for and we hired someone with less experience in the end. \n\nDepending on what the different rounds of interviews are for each company, if you're getting rejected out on round 1, it may be that you weren't passing that individual interview phase. Usually if you'll lose out to a more experienced candidate as the reason, you'd end up going through more stages and lose out near the end of the interview process when they're comparing candidates as to who to hire.\n\nFor example, if you're a solid candidate and you did really well on an the initial screen, it's not likely they're going to reject you unless they filled the position already.\n\nI'm not saying it doesn't happen, but as someone who's been hiring engineers for over a decade, I can say that if you're consistently not passing round 1 or round 2 and there are more rounds ahead of that, then it's likely you didn't meet the standards that they had to pass you to the next stage.; On my resume, I usually put the city/state that I'm looking for jobs in, so I think you should be good putting the address of home you're planning to move back to.; I suggest side projects to help you build a code library and get a cert in AWS or other platforms. Best way to learn is hands-on coding your own project. Who knows, maybe you could come up with a novel proof-of-concept and sell it. Also, get some freelance work if you can.; Thanks for the second opinion!"

   "Top Comments": "Does Cloudflare do takehome exercises; I have an interview next week for an entry-level project management role. It's my first job interview since I graduated but I can't seem to focus on the interview prep. Even the \"Introduce yourself\" question stressing me out. Everything seem so hard. Any suggestions?; Has anyone interviewed with Samsung for an SD1 role before? This is the only interview I’ve gotten in months, so I really, really need this!\n\nI assumed the technical interview would involve LC style problems but it doesn’t seem to be the case from my phone call with the recruiter. More specifically, they said they could not “confirm nor deny” that there would be LC style questions. From what I’ve been told, I will first speak to the mentor assigned to the role for about 45 minutes and they will ask me anything about my resume and some technical questions. Then if I pass, I’ll be interviewed by the hiring manager.\n\nIf anyone has any insight into what style of technical questions those might be, I would really appreciate it! \nI looked into the team more on LinkedIn after the phone screen and it seems like everyone has a PhD so I’m scared 😭😭😭. I’m really excited about the team and the work they do but it feels so daunting as a new grad with only a bachelors.\n\nAlso, I have nothing lined up and no other interviews and who knows when I’ll get another chance like this?\nI know interviews can be team dependent, so for reference, the team works in the OS level. Should I expect questions about things like page tables and trap handlers and stuff? I’m going to be honest, I really don’t know that much about operating systems but I applied because I had a lot of fun in the OS course I took and want to know what it’s like to work on that in industry. But that’s the only experience with OS that I have. And now I’ll be getting questioned by people with PhDs 😭😭😭 Even if I don’t get an offer, I want to be prepared enough to at least not make a complete fool out of myself.; Will be getting a technical interview tomorrow. Position for Backend dev as Jr+. They asked me to have a project ready so I decided to use a REST API I made last year. Already had an interview yesterday and it sucked a lot.   \nDon't even know where to start, honestly it seems like a lot of effort for nothing.  \nI am... not even sure why am I ranting here, I'm just frustrated how every single person that I made projects with had NO DIFFICULTIES getting a job, and I've been dealing with all these technical interviews, tests, and all sorts of filters, with no much luck. I'm just insanely angry about it, as much as I am mad.  \nI know I should test my API but even then what if they just say \"Documentation?\", \"Testing?\", \"Did you use this technology?\". I don't even know what's wrong, one of the peers I talked to even said that his boss said \"You'll learn this through\" and just hired him. He has a Bachelor's and I have an Associate's degree, it can't just be that.  \nWhy am I ranting this much? OH i just hate this. I hate everything, I don't even know what's wrong with me. This is awful, I wish I was dead.; Not knowing how you answer to the question, but some of those are trick questions.\n\nIn reality most employers don't really care about specifics, they care about good cultural fits and a good understanding of concepts. Yes - concepts. Knowing how to design a REST API properly in Python is the same as in Java or Go.\n\nWhy did his boss say you'll learn this? He probably demonstrated soft skills and technical skills to indicate he likes to learn, which I don't really get from your comments, neglecting learning testing and how to write documentation given the, \"I know I should test my API but even then what if they..\"\n\nObviously this is a tough situation, but you should have a growht mindset and try grow. Why not test your API? Maybe others have it easier but that does not change your reality. Try to boss up.\n\n  \nDrop your Github in DMs I'll give some feedback"

   "Title": "Are you less likely to land a job if you live in a different town than the job you’re applying to?",
   "Top Comments": "I think it matters. It creates an uncertainty in the mind of the hiring manager, and that makes them less likely to even consider the candidate.; >smaller companies\n  \nif you re-read what you just wrote for 30 seconds you should have your answer... of course?\n  \nthat being said though, I never apply to companies that are that small, there's a certain amount of expectation too from candidate side, which includes stuff like OK with me not being local and OK with bringing immigration lawyers for me, if the company is not OK with those then we end the interview immediately: not a good fit, I'm not who they're looking for and vice versa, nothing wrong with that from either side; Yes, but a better way to word it is you get an advantage if you live near the office. Obviously living near improves employee happiness, and, doesn’t need to pay for moving expenses. So it’s a win win to hire a local.; Same metro area, doesn't matter. Another state, some places might care, others just make sure you let them know you're looking to move to their town as soon as you get the job.; I applied to a job at a smaller company a few months ago, I had all the skills they wanted but was rejected two days later. I then realized I knew someone who knows someone there and that person reached out and found out I was rejected because one of their first for filters for rejection is location, if you weren't currently within 45 minutes of their office your application was automatically rejected.\n\nFor smaller companies if you're willing to relocate on your own dime then find a friend or acquaintance who lives there and is willing to let you use their address; What I've seen is that they hope that you stick around longer because you are committed to the area. They hope that you have friends or even family nearby. If you move in \"just for them\" you're more likely to quickly leave the area again in a few years as you're less likely to have anything that keeps you there.\n\nYou can use a cover letter to give them a good reason why you specifically want to move in that area and why you might want to actually \"commit\" to it. But be warned: if they get the impression that you only use them as a first \"way into that area\" they can also bail. It's a gamble on which side of weird thinking a company falls and what they actually want to hear from people outside the area (if they even give them a chance - when they have great candidates inside that area they often don't bother with others).; As a hiring manager for an in-person job I might be more inclined to interview local people over people from far away, but there's no way I would limit myself to only local people. If you're hiring for a role in a non-tech-hub city, you should have a relocation budget on the table. If you're not in the same city but are close by in the region, I would probably consider you local-ish.  \nWhat you really want to avoid is someone moving there to tak the job, hating the city, and quitting in a year. Hiring local or from the same region makes that less likely, they know what they're getting into.; Yes. ; Yes, it definitely makes a difference, especially at the resume screening step. Recruiters have zillions of resumes to filter through, and filtering based on location is a good and frankly fair way to knock out lots of candidates. \n\nIf you know ahead of time that you'd be willing to relocate (whether you'd get assistance or not), I recommend finding a local residential address and putting that on your application. It's definitely helped me land interviews in the past.\n\nThe job market is tougher than it used to be, but good engineers are still hard to hire. If you're a strong candidate with a good fit to the company's team, _most_ companies will do what they can to make the hire happen.; Yes 100%; This has quite literally 0 statistical significance but out of the hundreds of internships I applied to, the one that I got offered was the only one in the suburb of the major city nearest to where I live; I have applied for like 1 or 2 jobs in my exact town. But I have applied for hundreds that are within a 1 hour drive from me.\n\nI have interviewed with companies on the other side of the country from me. They were very few. A couple of them made me job offers that I eventually turned down. I bet it was harder to get an offer from any of these companies far away though.; In my experience no. As long you can make the commute you are fine.\n\nI had a role where I drove 50 miles to my job 50 miles back until I moved.; I believe it affects some. I got my current job because I live closer.; There was another post about “signal to noise ratio” in hiring. Part of that conversation went to bigger gains from just deciding who is able to be an employee of the company (in any position) from the stack of resumes rather than hunting for some hidden message in leetcode results. \n\nSo, I’d think a solid company that has experience hiring may look at something like your current location vs the location of the job and broad filter that given the drive of apps hitting their inboxes these days. \n\nOld school trick to beat that system, get a friend in the city you want to work in, put their address on your resume and if you get an interview, red eye flight and do it. Never mention you had to move. That one dates way way back to the way back times before the 90s. \n\nI’ve recently been pondering if my area code in my phone number is casting doubts for my resume in the application filtering robots. But at least my current employment is local to where I’m applying so maybe not… I dunno. I should test it.; Why would companies have an issue with people applying from out of town if they’re willing to relocate?; What if you're willing to pay for relocation out of your own pocket?; That’s a good point too. If it’s so easy for the candidate to move to them, it’ll be just as easy for the candidate to bail later. \n\nAlso, many people have taken shit roles in new cities just to back a move to said city so they can be local and get a better gig. \n\nThat was an old strategy before so much remote. If one lived in Meridian Mississippi and wanted a higher salary, then they’d have to move to a bigger metro. They would take literally any job to get there and then bail after a few months when they’re finally local and competing as a local. It’s how I got to CA. \n\nSo, some employers may not want to be the stepping stone for people trying to relo for better. Especially if they know they aren’t as competitive in terms of being an employer: lower pay, older tech, sadder projects, etc. They still need an employee, but they need someone who’ll stick around. The kid down the block, who’s been there for a while (several positions and years of employment locally) is likely more planted and easier to keep around.; there's been a couple companies that I remember over the past ~3 months that insists on candidates that are already local, doesn't matter if you're willing to relocate or not\n  \nyou're not already in city XYZ? they tell you no-go; A. They plan on RTO soon or just after they hire. Remote was just a gimmick to get resumes.\n\nB. Deal with the devil you know. There are a lot of factors that can postpone a move, especially if the hiring company isn’t footing the bill. Even if they are… I have a sibling whose spouse just relocated and they’re living in a hotel for 3 weeks while kids finish the school year. That kind of separation and unbalanced parental duties, plus the stress of moving in general can tax productivity of the new hire. "

   "Title": "So when do I start being able to start understanding large, complex codebases?",
   "Top Comments": "Very few people \"understand\" the Linux kernel. A lot of people understand *parts* of the Linux kernel. Maintainers have spent years or even decades working on their section of the kernel. You're not going to understand large complex codebases like this overnight.; The reality is that beyond a certain level of complexity, *no one* understands the whole system. Stroustrup famously admitted to no longer knowing the entirety of the C++ specification (despite being its creator).  \n\n\nWhen you get to that point, you typically divide and conquer via delegation: different people own different parts of the system. There's of course a variety of strategies and tools to cope with complexity at an individual level. Normally you learn them gradually by taking on increasingly more complex systems over the course of your career.; Linus would eventually fail if you grilled him closed book on niche enough stuff in that code base. Good software is about organizing the code so you don't need to think about the rest of it when working on a piece of it, not about holding every single thing in your head.\n\nBasically, a really good engineer will have a *general* understanding of the whole stack all of the way down, not a specific understanding of every part. Then they use that general understanding to help them navigate to the specific part they need to be looking at.\n\nFor lower level stuff, the best resource I'm familiar with for building that kind of general understanding is nand2tetris.\n\nLike, computers are a set of basic operations implemented as circuits, where the circuits are just structures of simple logic gates, which are made of patterns of transistors. Those run on a CPU and can interact with various peripherals, like collections of persistent gates we call memory. Machine code is a list of those operations, or \"instructions\", nothing else. Assembly provides basic hooks for organizing calls to those instructions. The next level of language, like c, provides much more convenient ways to manage assembly, having a compiler that turns the code into the right assembly for that platform, and basic patterns for data like a concept of a \"character\". Then a high level language provides more powerful abstractions for organizing code, like a \"class\".\n\nAn operating system provides a set of basic tools for making the computer usable, like allowing it to run specific code when it starts, to have a concept of a \"file\" and relevant organization, to render things on a screen, or to accept the input from a keyboard. Each of those peripherals needs a driver, which is code that defines how the CPU should send and receive data from the peripheral, etc.\n\nA well organized code base will basically follow the same pattern as the high level description of the way things fit together. So if you were demanded to implement support in Linux for a new kind of text encoding because a lovecraftian nightmare of an alien language reads in 2 dimensions at the same time, you would have a vague but not fully formed sense of all of the main pieces of the system that rely on the assumption that text is a one dimensional array, and you'd be able to start working/grepping through everything that needs to change for the rest of your mortal life, because there's only so much you can really do in a huge code base.; Nobody really does this, it is not humanly possible to understand every line of a multi-million line codebase. A well-organized codebase will have functionality separated into distinct modules and components so that you can focus on a specific area of the codebase without needing to know too much about the rest. You would typically have a specific task at hand, find the files that relate to the task, and spend some time reading and understanding that specific portion of the codebase.\n\nAlso to add: Just because you see a large amount of code in a single github repository, doesn't mean you have to mentally think of it as one codebase. Oftentimes it makes more sense to think of it as lots of little codebases: the files in folder A are for feature X, the files in folder B are for feature Y, etc. Sometimes it's even literally the case that the code in one folder can run completely independently of the code in some other folder.; Hopefully the code base comes with technical documentation and system design diagrams helping to explain the system from a high level and hopefully documentation in the code itself to explain whats going on code wise.; That's the neat part: you don't!\n\n\nThe machinations of the full Linux kernel is going to be well beyond any single person's ability to grasp. Everytime I've worked on a large code base, the only entities that know the full workings of the software are the CI/CD worker machines.; I think some people are honestly just gifted for it. Like yeah they obviously need to do the work to get there, but it’s like their brains can handle MASSIVE amounts of complex code with ease. \n\nIt’s kinda like how there are guys that play football their whole life trying to get to the NFL, play all the way up through D1 college and just never make it no matter how hard they try. \n\n-Also a 2nd year dev with a CS degree working in a large code base and wondering how the seniors and principals I work with do it.; > I thought to myself after about 30 seconds of staring at this thing...\"wow, I have absolutely no idea what any of this means\"\n\nLet's be real, 30 seconds is not a long time, give yourself a bit more credit here.\n\n> I certaintly don't know how a giant system like this is sustained, and coordinated by thousands of its contributors.\n\nIt's a giant system *because* it has thousands of contributors.\n\n> Like...how and when will I get to the point of understanding a repo like Linux, and everything that's invovled with it? \n\nHow much value do you expect this to give you? This is like saying \"I would like to be able to read an encyclopedia from cover to cover and understand all of it, quickly\". That sounds crazy to me.\n\nRealistically, when you start contributing to a large project, you'll only be working on specific parts, improving sections of the code base at a time. When you suddenly get airdropped into the middle of the ocean, knowing how the entire ocean works probably isn't too relevant.\n\nAfter you start getting more experienced with programming, you tend to recognize more patterns and learn where to look to get the specific information you need to complete a task. Everything else is unimportant, because if it's unrelated to the task at hand and designed in an unsurprising way, it probably works as expected (and if it doesn't, then that's a problem for someone else, or future you).; Open up the whole project, start the find all references goose chase. It helps if you know the boot up sequence. I use Visual Assist to make reference searching faster. \n\nYou probably picked the craziest example though. I don’t know if it’s even possible to understand Linux first glance within 30 seconds. \n\nIt’s like opening a history book at a random page then being overwhelmed at not knowing the entirety of human history!; Give it time, mate. Understanding big codebases is like leveling up in a game - takes practice and patience. Keep diving in, asking questions, and experimenting. You'll get there sooner than you think!; There's a massive gap between Large + Complex and the Linux Kernel. There are probably only a handful of people in the world that are close to fully understanding it.; You never understand it completely. You learn how to search effectively and catch up quickly how this part works on a higher level.\n\nHuman brain simply can't remember everything, unless you have one of those rare brain conditions that gives you a super memory.\n\nSo over time and experience you become better making it look like you know all, when you are actually catching up quickly by reading the code.; You may never get there, or it may take years.\n\nIt's a long slog to get to the point where you can really *get* large projects, plenty of programmers never really get there.; Read more code. Start at the beginning of the app.  Then keep reading and debuggin until you see the patterns.; Stick to the scope of your ticket and learn new sections of code as you go. Eventually, you'll have worked enough in each part of the code to know how to navigate and understand each piece. \n\nAlso practice the basics. It will get you so far don't take it for granted.\n\nNew repo... rinse and repeat.; You have to spend time and effort with it, there’s no shortcut.; You should start with understanding the part you need to understand or your senior/manager wants you to understand. That's how it starts for everyone.\n\nWe had an entire web application structure. I got intimidated by it a lot when I first saw it. Then my seniors gave me smaller tasks. Then they slowly grew.\n\nIn a year, I had an idea about how things worked at the app. In fact I could find solutions to the problems on my own related to the codebase. Such that seniors stopped with interfering my work, developing full trust in me.; You are not meant to. Unless it some sort of microservice orchestration, with an architecture graph right there for you, or some medium sized but well segmented code base you cannot expect of yourself to look and see. \n\n  \nWhen you start a job, there are days, sometimes a week or two just to get accustomed to one part of codebase you will be responsible for.  \nLike, at my company I worked for 5 years on a single product and I do know it, but it is because I got lucky and got to work start to maturity on a single product and because I got to do it for 5 years. \n\nLike, maybe after 6-10 years, you will see enough various projects, that you will gain intuition about their architecture and micro and macro structure, but most people really don't. And sometimes, even when you have solution architects, they know the overall ins and outs, but not details, because for big enough projects, it is just not efficient to even have one person to know it all when he can just get better at the aspect he is actually responsible for.; On a previous project, even after being with it for more than 5 years, I still don't understand the whole thing. It's an old legacy code, by the way. A mishmash of C/C++/Java.; It's all about abstractions. I have been working with the same codebase for 2 years now, and there are things I have no idea about basically (because I have never touched the code). \n\nYou can look at the code base in different ways. The functionality it provides. The architecture and patterns it has over time etc. and not to mention what people thought the codebase would do over time.\n\nI had the (naive) thought as a junior that things were well thought out and defined, but you will see that a large code base, or a code base over time with different people, will have lots of weird patterns and setups due to ...\n\n- the intention of the code base might have changed, sometimes they think they can sell some of the code in modules, so all the code is \"modular\", but implemented badly because it never panned out\n\n- older code styles and versions i.e Objective-C programmers doing things not so Swifty, and having Swift 2.0 APIs and style in lots of code\n\nBut after a while with a codebase, and overall programming, you'll see abstractions of what is going on with functionality, and that patterns are mixed together some places etc. \n\nCodebases and teams should have some (at least) some *guided documentation* about what is going on and why. You don't need (or shouldn't need) the whole history about the codebase, but what the codebase is for, how it is doing things and why it is doing things that way.... but that doesn't always happen, so you sometimes don't even get a feel for it unless you actually run the code and do stuff yourself also, but that's a slow process unfortunately, but it still gets better with experience.\n\nHang in there, and don't demand too much of yourself, you'll learn that you can't and don't need to know everything there is in programming, even the codebase you work on *a regular basis*. Learn as needed, that's the most important skill."

Your 12+ years of tech experience will still be a major asset, but some places might stick to the CS degree requirement. It's worth checking specific job listings and maybe even chatting with folks in your network who've been through similar situations to get a feel for what's most valued in your field. Good luck!; Is there a reason you'd pick something other than a CS degree?; I’ve only had my lack of CS degree (or any degree for that matter) hurt me directly a few times in my career. I do wonder in this market if it would be more of a problem though, just because it’s an easy filter for recruiters, not because of any real impact. By the time you finish it may once again not matter other than public sector roles.; Get the degree in your spare time, but make your employer pay for it.\n\nMy graduate degree was essentially free.; Why would you not get it in CS if you don’t have a bachelors at all. The only time I think it may make less sense to get a CS degree is if you already have a BS and work experience."

You can apply for industry internships while in grad school in that case.\n\nIf you're not quite that extreme and set on specifically that path, then the balance would swing more towards the internship.\n\nP.S. whatever you do now is unlikely to have much long-term impact at all, on average, so don't worry too much.; It sounds like you've got two solid options on your plate! For me, it's all about what floats your boat. With the internship, you're rolling in that sweet, sweet cash, but sacrificing some serious chill time. On the flip side, research offers flexibility and maybe even some paper fame, but it's a bit of a hike from home. Think about your priorities and what you wanna dive deep into. Either way, you're making moves, so props to you!; I'm not going straight to grad school, because undergrad honestly drained me financially. I need to get some kind of work before I pursue any higher education beyond my bachelors. I heard you can get work and they'll pay for your masters so that's what I'm hoping I'll do in the future. If I go through with the research I hope it'll help me get into a good grad school.; Would recommend the internship then because the hardest step is getting the first job."

As long as they've got a decent website and seem legit, I wouldn't stress about it too much. Plus, having an unclaimed page might just mean they haven't bothered with it yet, not that they're shady or anything.; Also, what does the company do? Even if it's a small company, if it's selling some tech, this could be a red flag. But if their target audience/service or product offered is IRL, then it might not matter much.; I would not say red, but at least yellow(for small companies). Its kinda the basics to have one if you want to be a serious business. I would try to speak with them on why thay dont have it and where you can find more information about them.; I would recommend finding out as much information as you can during the interview process.

You may never get a job as product dev from this path, though.  \n\nWhen I became a EE morphing to FW engineer decades ago, I never thought we'd be flooding markets with H1Bs from India. From national security point of view alone, it seemed impossible. I hate what this industry has become, specifically the social/libertarian culture evolving around tech bros.\n\nFrankly, you won't get far without knowing someone on the inside and some way to demonstrate skill.  Your story is not unique.  I can tell you lots of stories about 5.0 GPA and \"Top School\" engineers who were real-life idiots. A few are now working at MSFT, Amazon and Google now.

Unions are needing electricians , HVAC, iron workers, etc Infrastructure bill has created massive demand for trades, also creating some decent jobs.\n\nGood luck; An associates will not help you compete in this market.\n\nSpend your time completing a CS degree.; I appreciate the feedback, I'm hoping to do some API service type stuff soon on my home server to prove my worth and a few websites but I keep having to fight the idea that the projects need to be something better than existing tools lol; not op but I've been thinking about stop learning basic web development things like html, css and JavaScript and focus on back end stuff since front end looks really saturated right now, am I doing right about ignoring some stuff in my studies?; What do you suggest I do to stay alive while doing that; Aws free tier for lambda and most other stuff is pretty big. I'm building stuff there now just to learn and get some stuff to throw on my github. Free tier for lambda is like 400k GB/s.; I'm not qualified to comment on front-end web development, however, I know there are a few areas which pay very well but are also super competitive (in no order).\n\n- JAVA, it seems like it is never going away. \n\n- C++ , I hate this language, it is the Latin of tech bro Caesars. I am competent, but hate how hyped it is. Ironically, I have been employed in past replacing C++ with C to reduce line count and complexity. It gets out of hand so quick unless you have massive teams to constantly refactor and review, Google can afford that I guess. I want to start saving psychotic C++ constructions into a book called \"C++, what the fuck, dude?\" My favorite is miles of C++ merged with miles of reg-ex. But everyone else loves loves loves C++, lol. I don't think this is a reasonable path for you, it takes years and years to master this language. Like Latin.  \n\n- Python, a language that is ubiquitous and utilitarian. Recommend learning it, not really optional.\n\n- Javascript, sure, but only as it relates to a well known framework.\n\nI think back-end is critical right now. Also, dev ops is enjoying a renaissance and many companies are paying dev wages to guys who write python build scripts, and launch docker shells. You mostly deal with open source frameworks etc and have to be on call 24/7 dealing with all the quirks related to really odd implementations.\n\nNote that if you do not have formal schooling you will struggle to find any work in this business as developer. You will never get close to Google, et al. I wish this were not true, but with guys from India  flooding market from schools with random quality, you won't have a chance. \n\nDemocrats have put a few billion into bringing some tech back to USA with massive investment in chip factories, infrastructure and related technologies, there are some automation jobs related to that.

You can learn that, no prob.

My current idea is applying to low level tech support jobs but I'm just really struggling; Yes you and everyone else looking for easy IT support jobs is struggling right now.\n\nIf you want what everyone else wants, you have to compete.

It's something you have to clarify on your own.; Are you in the US, in an at-will State? If so, you can be fired for any non-protected reason, or no reason at all. Your manager could fire you cause you looked at them funny.\n\n>\"change my resignation date\"\n\nThat aside, I'm not entirely sure what you/he mean by this. Did you not provide your notice of resignation in writing? As in, over email so there's a paper trail with hard proof of the date you provided the notice, and your last day? How could he change an email you sent? If you only gave verbal notice.... well, you learned a lesson today about why paper trails are important.\n\nBut that doesn't really make any sense to me.\n\nMaybe by this they meant just let you go now and pay out the rest of your 2 weeks. That's not uncommon in the US. Sometimes when you hand in your notice companies just decide to let you go right there and then and don't want you to continue working. If they want you to leave on good terms, you get your last 2 weeks of pay like normal, you just don't actually work them. If they want to burn the bridge they might just fire you.\n\nThis would make a lot more sense to me, especially since what caused it was his interpretation of you not contributing to the team. So he may not be changing the \"resignating date\" per se, but moreso your final day of work.\n\nI would try and better understand what they mean by that.

Giving notice isn't required- it's a courtesy to not burn bridges.  If things are already crap there isn't even reason to give 2 weeks notice.; It’s definitely worth documenting this behavior for your exit interview with HR.; You're obviously never going to work with this guy again. Let him fire you, and then collect unemployment.; Your work place can fire you without pay but it’s kind of a bad idea because it creates an opportunity for you to file for unemployment.\n\nWhat’s more common is they pay you for your notice period and ask you not to come in.; This depends on where you work. \n\nIn the lovely state of Texas, it is fully legal to change your resignation date as long as it within 2 weeks of the resignation date. This will not make you eligible for unemployment, as the state sees it still as you having resigned. If they let you go with 15 days left, interestingly enough it would count as having been fired. \n\nOther states this is not the case. So you need to look up your states employment laws.; If you are an at-will employee, you can resign today with no notice. Notice is a sign of respect. IF your contract says otherwise or your local laws do, then stick to the letter of that.; >I explicitly do not want him to change my date and I will message HR if it comes down to it that I haven't given my explicit consent for him to do this\n\nGet ahead of it and tell HR via email. ASAP, so that if he tries to pull anything they're aware before he does it. State the facts. You tendered your resignation on <date>, with your last day being <date>. Your manager has threatened to change the dates, and here's the screenshot to prove it. You are feeling intimidated and bullied by your boss.; Looks like the bridge is already burned. File a harassment complaint with HR. They’ll only protect the company, but at least they’ll know the manager was up to these shenanigans ; Looks like the guy is trying to come up with any kind of semi-justified reason to fire you before your termination date.\n\n* Tell your boss that the meeting was optional, and you were not made aware of the need of your presence on that meeting in any way, since your experience with that technology is not enough to be of any use in said meeting, even less being \"an expert.\"\n\n* Also, regarding on what are you going to be doing, I would just write \"what the team has planned for me, knowledge sharing of my domain and whatever is required by the company for employees leaving.\n\n* Regarding changing the resignation date, as its been said, it depends on your contract and the law, but I would just repeat that your specified date is X and that any change would be without your consent.\n\n* About working in a different country, I would just forward the email to HR and would suggest him that if he's suspecting anything, it should talk with their legal department and making it official, not with you.\n\n* To finish, I would put all of this in an email to HR: You put a two week notice in good faith to allow the rest of the team some time to react to the change and you're getting a weird treatment from the team leader that you don't understand. There's been some comments that could be seen as threats (not that you think they are), but are somewhat out of tune, and some odd references to you breaching contract without further proof that are making you extremely uncomfortable. You are specially worried about the date change in your termination, and would like to know if he can do it and reiterate that the end date was what it was and you have no plan on changing it.\n\nI can only think the guy is an asshole with more problems than some engineer leaving but that having someone leaving in his team is going to impact him somehow, so he's trying to find any reason to fire you during these days. But that's the story I've come up with with what you wrote, so who knows what's going on.\n\nLook at the bright side of this: In two weeks it's gonna be over.; if i saw a manager do this to a coworker and i got a new job, i would email out sick until they threatened to fire me, then quit on the spot by email. block their numbers. not respond. and not return the laptop."

This is the most chaotic engineering discipline out there. \n\nMost codebases are without a doubt as organized and structured as a third world country's electric grid.; Definitely don't expect someone to sit down and teach me stuff, but would highly appreciate any guidance at all. \n\nWith there being a lot less experienced seniors than junior and mid level, and with the field growing and growing, I just feel like self-taught is key in this profession because it's such a new discipline of engineering.; It’s because everything we do is on a screen \n\n  \nminimal inter personal skills; Given how many people have serious career deficiencies in CS, I don't think self-educating is getting the job done. \n\nIf it is your preference, that is a decision that you can make for yourself. But many people in this field are begging for any sort of guidance. And in most situations, people benefit from quality mentorship - even if it is just for strategic matters & answering questions about the field.   \n  \nAll developers should expect that picking up programming languages (specifically syntax) is going to be a self-learning pursuit. But there are few or no books to describe the answers to well more than half the questions that are asked here. In fact, for the few good books that do exist, they seem to rarely come up when people ask questions that the books could answer thoroughly. Most devs do not read books (going instead with online syntax glossaries) and could not readily tell you a good book to read about Computer Science career planning. If anyone is going to roll out the titles of a bunch of non-syntax books in this thread, I strongly suggest you save a copy of that list to suggest to other people when they ask questions and the only answer they're getting is \"more Leetcode\".; That seems to be what I see. I'll attempt at finding mentors, at the very least I can create some connections and bounce ideas off others. \n\nBut for sure books are always a solid place to start. It's just really starting to dawn on me how new this engineering discipline that we will have to rely on books more than people as well as experimenting/hands-on experience at the workplace.; I'm currently in a team of only 2 devs, we're pretty new to development in a professional sense. \n\nI work at a university -- I suppose I could reach out to other software developers outside of my department. I had never thought of that. I especially never thought about reaching outside my workplace, I could surely do that and perhaps even create new connections that way!\n\nOf course I will also do my own homework in learning about whatever I can with some books I've seen mentioned around online a few times. As well as videos and whatever I can grab my hands on. \n\nThank you for the guidance!; I appreciate the bluntness, lol; I totally agree.\n\nHowever, many mentees beg for a mentor and, when they get one, they flake after a few conversations.  As a result, there are fewer and fewer free mentors and the free mentors take mentees less seriously (or are very selective).\n\nMentors tend to be older and more reliable.  Mentees tend to be younger and less reliable.  So, it’s a tragedy of the commons: bad mentees “use up” the mentors so there are very few mentors.; It turns out... there is a book about this.\n\nIt's called \"Mentoring Programs That Work\" and I read it and summarized it and gave recommendations relating to mentorship programs to my last company to meet my yearly goal-setting requirements in my performance review. (I did well on the review; they didn't act on my recommendations; they laid me off soon afterward)   \n  \nThe \"flake\" factor works on both sides but it has to be scheduled around by the program manager. If a mentee flakes, the mentor should be assigned another mentee, or be given more time with mentees who live up to the commitment. In reverse, if a mentor flakes (and they quite often do - \"I got busy\"), the mentees who are abandoned need to be reassigned if they are still engaged. There are very simple techniques to drive engagement and get around distractions/disorganizations in mentorship programs & hold participants accountable. In a small organization, it may help to engage in outside programs or partner with other companies to build the user base, so that the flake factor on a single team can't derail the whole thing.\n\nNo one on either side should regard a mentorship assignment as an optional engagement after a commitment has been made to the program. That just \\*sucks\\*. If the point of all of this is that there aren't enough people in CS who are reliable to each other, in order to get critical mass on a program like this... yeah I'd love for that point to come across. I do believe that. I think team leads and managers blame juniors/mentees for not reading their minds, and I think juniors and staff don't do enough to seek advice and peer connections among each other. Part of the problem is that people ask for advice and then get told \"Yeah, do I have to do everything for you?\" because there is no culture in this industry of peer counseling/expertise sharing as a management expectation. It's literally no one's job to help others. So we don't. And many devs reason backwards as to why the way they don't ask for help OR give help is the best approach for everyone.; You’re talking about company mentorship programs.  The OP and I were talking about “in the wild” mentorship.; Same concepts. There's nothing special about in-the-wild; it may seem difference-making that program sponsors for in-the-wild programs have zero recourse for flakes, but company programs tend not to have any official recourse for flakes built into them, either. Especially not for flaky managers."

   "Top Comments": "Your analysis labors under a number of incorrect understandings and presumptions.\n\n> For the past 50 years or so, the Boomers have considered US Treasury bonds as the \"safest\" asset in the world, and thus spent **all their hard-earned money on it**\n\nNo, they didn’t. Not even remotely close to “all” their money went to buying treasury bonds. Some of their money did, sure, but most of their money went into other things—homes, other sorts of diversified investments in 401ks, etc. very few 401k accounts have even a majority in bonds. That would be a highly conservative strategy. The usual advice is 80% stocks, 20% bonds. \n\n> which are required by law to own bonds as a %age of their portfolios\n\nThey are certainly also allowed to invest in other things too. Ex. Only around 1/3rd of CalPERS is invested in bonds. \n\n> The unfortunate reality is that both sides of the aisle grossly mismanaged that money, spending it on wars they didn't need to get into and lining the pockets of their friends/donors.\n\nWho was responsible for what? Since 1980…\n\nRonald Reagan (R): 160% increase in gov’t debt.\n\nGeorge HW Bush (R): 42% increase in gov’t debt.\n\nBill Clinton (D): 29% increase in gov’t debt.\n\nGeorge W Bush (R): 73% increase in gov’t debt.\n\nBarack Obama (D): 64% increase in gov’t debt.\n\nDonald Trump (R): 33% increase in gov’t debt.\n\nJoe Biden (D): 8% increase in gov’t debt. \n\nAdmittedly, Biden’s not through his first term yet, but it seems doubtful Congress is going to go on a sudden spending spree. \n\nSo, by party…\n\nDemocrats averaged a 34% increase in gov’t debt while in office.\n\nRepublicans averaged a 77% increase in gov’t debt while in office. Almost twice as high a growth rate. \n\nClearly one party is far, far more responsible for our debt than the other. \n\n> Now, the US state has no money to pay back the Boomers\n\nBecause the federal government refuses to raise taxes. It has plenty of headroom to raise them, but it refuses to do so for ideological reasons—Republicans refuse to even consider the possibility, despite being the ones responsible for the tax cuts that created the deficit problem in the first place. \n\nThe average net tax burden in the US (including state and local taxes) is 24.2%. The OECD average is 24.6%. We could very easily afford to increase that a bit and use it to start paying down the deficit. \n\n> rather by the state printing money to pay back the boomers with\n\nExcept it hasn’t been doing that. The government pays back old debt with new debt, it’s not “printing money” for that purpose, it’s having to pay debt servicing costs to borrow even more money to pay interest on old debt that is maturing.\n\n> and taxes are already at close to 50% in states like California\n\nNo, they aren’t. You’re just adding top marginal rates together to get that, but that’s not how actual taxes work. \n\n> The Treasury is responsible for issuing debt to meet the working capital requirements set by Congress and the executive branch, i.e., the President's office. \n\nA) That’s not “printing money”, because it’s moving money from one account to another. It doesn’t expand the money supply for the government to do this.\n\nB) Congress has the sole responsibility here, though the President could in theory veto the budget.\n\n> What happens when the government needs money, but the bonds are already tapped out and can't afford to lend them any more of ours?\n> That's where the Fed comes in.\n\nNo, it doesn’t. That’s not what the fed does. It’s not there as a piggy bank for the government to tap when it can’t borrow enough.\n\nSure, they set the fed funds rate and the discount rate, but not to fill holes in the federal budget. \n\n> This creates a system where the Fed, which is one arm of the state, lends money to the banks, which then lend money to the Treasury, another arm of the state. In effect, this is just the government borrowing money and printing more to pay it back.\n\nIf that’s what they were doing with it, sure.  But it’s not. Banks do not exclusively lend to the federal government, and they don’t lend to it at 0% interest rates. The federal reserve doesn’t actually authorize u limited borrowing, and sets rates and limits according to their own inflation targets.\n\nIn theory it *could* create hyperinflation, but in practice it institutionally avoids it.\n\n> You guys have been getting poorer slowly but surely, and a lot faster in recent years since 2008, b/c the state has financially exploited you for the past 50 years through taxes and inflation to fund its misguided political ideologies.\n\nThis is just plain incorrect. \n\nThe current situation *is* partly caused by the higher interest rates making it harder for companies to borrow money for growth efforts, but it’s also caused by Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expiring a tax credit for R&D spending in 2023. \n\nNearly all of this is squarely at the feet of Republicans—it’s not a “both sides” thing. Sure, Democrats haven’t fixed the tax credit problem, but that’s because Republicans in the House refuse to even bring much of anything Democrats propose to the floor. ; You know what's fucking hilarious. I literally woke up this morning thinking \"I think it's about time to do some public service and explain to the allegedly very smart tech people how the economy works. \"\n\nYou beat me to it, as I literally just stopped work for the day and came here to start writing! I disagree with a lot of your conclusions of the situation, but great job on the essay!; This is a solid write up, with respect to how the Fed and treasury rates work. I wouldn’t say Boomers necessarily put most or all of their money into treasury assets, but most risk assets (even Bitcoin) these days are correlated to Treasury notes/bonds rates, either inversely (gold, stocks, etc) or directly (oil, some commercial metals). Also, as you said, the pension and other fund allocators invest in these debt instruments as a means of earning yield.\n\nMost important is your note on the falling supremely of the US dollar. As Saudi (and allied) oil moves away from strictly using the petrodollar and countries across the globe realize how hard they have been screwed by our government’s obsession with printing money and giving it to citizens and large corporations for nothing in return, the US dollar is being phased out of its dominant status. This loss of financial leverage means that America will undergo huge quality of life changes in the coming years.\n\nLastly, I left this comment to offset some of the pointless downvotes from people who know nothing about banking/finance, geopolitics, or history. You are sharing information in a sub filled with people whose future is inherently threatened by this reality (young, hopeful future tech workers) so it’s understandable that they would want to brush this off as bs. There is a pandemic of confident ignorance across the internet these days, spearheaded by the podcasting/guru industry, so don’t feel discouraged if you’re not getting the reception you expected. The truth will reveal itself after some time.; You should start a YouTube channel with content like this.; Very good write up. +1; good chunk of debt is/was used to  fight wars and bailouts.   Wish it was used to improve/fix our infrastructure, education, healthcare, homelessness …..; How is it that Biden is only at 8% of debt spending when we're currently spending 1 trillion every 90 days right now?  That figure just looks really low to me; Part 1:\n\nThe amount of mental gymnastics you put into finding a way to blame this on the Republicans is *fucking bonkers*. Don't get me wrong -- I'm pro-choice and anti-war -- but I wouldn't be surprised if you gave ChatGPT my post and asked it to come up with a Redditor-style counterargument that makes the GOP look bad.\n\nThe sad part is that you're getting upvoted b/c, even though nobody understands what the fuck you're saying, you ended it by blaming the Republicans.\n\n>Not even remotely close to “all” their money went to buying treasury bonds\n\nMaybe \"all\" is an exaggeration, but most \"responsible money\" is heavily weighted towards bonds, especially in these days with questionable economic circumstances.\n\nThe point is that the government borrowed too much and has no way to pay it back.\n\n>\\[The pension funds\\] are certainly also allowed to invest in other things too.\n\nYou quoted the part where I said, \"required by law\", but you don't seem to have read it or internalized what it means. These funds are forced under threat of a federal crackdown to buy bonds, and almost everything else is optional.\n\n>Who was responsible for what? Since 1980…\n\n>Ronald Reagan (R): 160% increase in gov’t debt.\n\n>George HW Bush (R): 42% increase in gov’t debt.\n\n>Bill Clinton (D): 29% increase in gov’t debt.\n\n>George W Bush (R): 73% increase in gov’t debt.\n\n>Barack Obama (D): 64% increase in gov’t debt.\n\n>Donald Trump (R): 33% increase in gov’t debt.\n\n>Joe Biden (D): 8% increase in gov’t debt. \n\n>Admittedly, Biden’s not through his first term yet, but it seems doubtful Congress is going to go on a sudden spending spree. \n\n>So, by party…\n\n>Democrats averaged a 34% increase in gov’t debt while in office.\n\n>Republicans averaged a 77% increase in gov’t debt while in office. Almost twice as high a growth rate.\n\nI have no idea where you're getting these numbers, but I've got a well-accepted [source](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/mar/12/joe-biden/fact-checking-joe-biden-on-debt-accumulated-under/) that says you're wrong. Scroll all the way to the bottom and the infographic says it all; Trump did borrow a lot of money, but Biden ended up borrowing more, and the worst offender by far was \"Black Jesus\" Barack.\n\nDirect quote from PolitiFact:\n\n>Experts say it’s hard to draw a straight line between any president and the debt accrued on their watch. But beyond that, there are different ways to view the numbers, and some of them are not favorable to Biden’s assertion.\n\nIn politically incorrect words, he's grasping at straws to make himself look good without actually doing anything.; Anything you wanna add to all this is welcome\n\nTech bros usually suffer from iamverysmart syndrome where they think the world bows down to them b/c they mastered Python and SQL, yet they understand little to nothing about the establishment they're working for. Then, all of a sudden, they're blindsided by a change in current events, and then you get a bunch of people who got fired trying to be based with the \"tech is dead; long live doomerism\" perspective.; I'm also interested to know: Which of my conclusions do you disagree with?; >most risk assets are correlated with treasury notes/bond rates\n\nThis is a double-edged sword b/c raising rates causes debt servicing costs to spike, which the government *also* can't handle being that they already spend 1/3 or more of tax receipts just *servicing* the debts (i.e., paying off the rate). Not only that, but bonds rolling over from 10 and 30 years ago at the new (higher) rates is a double-whammy.\n\nI would say stocks, real estate, gold/silver, sovereign debt, and anything held up by the dollar is going to take a hit with higher rates, whereas stuff like \"deep tech\" like Bitcoin and startups that nobody's heard of are going to outperform when rates are either exceptionally high or exceptionally low. Case in point, deep tech will shine at a time when there will be nothing else to help the average person survive, IMO.\n\n>You are sharing information in a sub filled with people whose future is inherently threatened by this reality\n\nYou'd think they'd take this opportunity to get ahead of the danger instead of pretending it doesn't exist, but I guess it's always easier to follow the herd.; Just check out KITCO News, Stansberry Research, or any of the other libertarian channels, and you'll get a lot of this content.; Which part of it is most interesting to you? Gimme an idea of what you wanna learn more about so I can recommend relevant content; Yup, all of that would have yielded enough growth to more than pay for it, in the end. \n\nInstead we spent it on two useless wars that did little to serve the national interest.\n\nTwo wars Republicans started, and Democrats ended, I would add. ; Because the debt he inherited when he came into office was immense.; Part 2:\n\nMore from you:\n\n>\\[The state\\] has plenty of headroom to raise \\[taxes\\], but it refuses to do so for ideological reasons\n\nFirst off, I'm willing to bet that you're saying this as you bite the bullet on a 30-45% net tax rate for the last fiscal year. You'd probably say \"that money built the roads that I use to get to work\" or something in response, but all your tax dollars did was provide liquidity for Hunter's cocaine fund.\n\nDialing back so I don't get ideological here...\n\nWe have to face the hard truth that most tax revenue comes from the upper-middle-class and the rich. Reason being, 10% of a watermelon is still greater than 100% of a grape. Nobody cares about the $15K that the Joe Everyman might owe at the end of the year; the bigger question is how many BILLIONS are owed by the likes of Elon and Bezos.\n\nIf you raise taxes on the rich and on big business, they'll just offshore their operations. That's what's already happening; Biden increased taxes and made it harder to get funded in the US, so companies like Google and Microsoft moved their teams to China and India, resulting in millions of American jobs lost.\n\n... Which is what this whole sub is complaining about\n\n>Republicans... \\[are\\] the ones responsible for the tax cuts that created the deficit problem in the first place\n\nThe *deficit problem* is that we borrowed money we can't pay back. The ones responsible for the deficit problem are the ones who borrowed the money, which I just said was both sides of the aisle.\n\nTax cuts might have exacerbated the problem by giving the state less \"revenue\" to pay off their existing debts and forcing them to borrow more, sure, but that's not what created the problem. Similarly, tax hikes wouldn't have solved the problem b/c normal people would just take the hit to their quality of life to pay the taxes (like they're doing now), and then we'd have all the same economic problems that we're seeing today.\n\n>The government pays back old debt with new debt, it’s not “printing money” for that purpose, it’s having to pay debt servicing costs to borrow even more money to pay interest on old debt that is maturing\n\nExactly, and the bond market is waking up to this, so they're not buying as many bonds. As a result, the Treasury has to raise bond rates in order to entice potential buyers, which means signing onto interest rates it can't afford.\n\nThat's like the average homeowner getting a second mortgage at twice the interest rate of the first one b/c they can't make this month's payments and need a bit of runway; it's not a situation you want to be in.\n\n>\\[The Fed's\\] not there as a piggy bank for the government to tap when it can’t borrow enough.\n\nI made a typo in my initial post which I've since fixed. What I meant was that the Fed is there to lend to banks when banks don't have any more capital to buy assets with, which is the whole point of their interest rates. Like I laid out, every chartered bank is entitled to borrow from them at the discount rate *by definition*, and the idea is to entice them to use the borrowed money to buy bonds and earn the credit spread b/w the Treasury rate and the Fed rate.\n\nThis is basically printing money, b/c it puts more money into circulation for the purpose of bailing out the Treasury.\n\n>Nearly all of this is squarely at the feet of Republicans\n\nI knew when I made this post that I'd get at least a few guys that either deny that this problem exists or find some way to blame it on the Republicans.\n\nHere I thought I was being intellectually honest by disclaiming my biases up front and not making any argument that overtly supports my \"side\", but you just *had* to make it political...; So in general I would say the data doesn't really support your position of \"the US is going broke slowly but surely\" or that we are rapidly losing our global hegemony, although I would absolutely agree the degree to which that hegemony is dominant is decreasing. \n\nThe US is not broke, and very little of the mechanics you described are some kind of \"fat cat upper class conspiracy\", but rather what is typically considered to be the optimal way to manage macro economic systems. We print money when people don't want to spend to keep the economy afloat, and then we burn money when the economy is overheating and driving higher inflation to prevent hyper inflation. We are getting poorer if you compare a 1980 dollar to a 2024 dollar, but that is intentional and not remarkable. Nor is it unique. Nearly countries have inflationary systems where a small target inflation rate is the goal to maximize gdp growth per year (if you lift weights at all, you can think of this like optimizing a bulk phase. You want to over eat calories and you might put on some fat doing so, but you want to maximize your proportional muscle gain to fat gain by having only a small caloric surplus). A stable economy would be theoretically possible without inflation, but would require nearly perfect precision interest rates and QE and limit GDP growth somewhat. Deflationary economies are very very bad for gdp growth.\n\nThe big difference here, and why tech is uniquely affected, is because tech relies heavily on investment and deficit spending for years before companies become profitable. Those startups and newer companies helped drive demand. Now that there are very few new companies appearing to eat up talent, only big established companies are hiring, and it has become a buyers market for labor talent. Combine that with a Trump era tax reform that made software engineering no longer a tax exempt write off and some mild pressure on reduced tech demand and over hiring and you get the current situation; >Tech bros usually suffer from iamverysmart syndrome where they think the world bows down to them b/c they mastered Python and SQL\n\nI have made a whole argument based on microeconomics and history - yeah shocking, a software engineer who actually knows stuff other than coding!!! - why the utter fixation on Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, etc and other hugely congested languages/frameworks is what led them to the mess they are in. \n\nSkills are a commodity. Commodities, in contrast to the notion that competition = innovation and that innovation = being able to sell that commodity, does NOT experience that same mechanic when the market becomes saturated. In fact the more one tries to lower the price (settling for lower wages) or increase quality (getting more YOE), the WORSE the competition gets because everyone will copy exactly what you do thus mitigating whatever immediate advantages you gained. \n\nGaming Leetcode tests? Yeah, iamverysmart syndrome guy, everyone is doing it too. \n\nGaming resumes with buzzwords to cheat ATS filters? Yeah, iamverysmart syndrome guy, everyone is doing it too. \n\nSpamming resumes? Yeah, iamverysmart syndrome guy, everyone is doing it too. \n\nGaming common interview questions? Yeah, iamverysmart syndrome guy, everyone is doing it too. \n\nWasting a huge chunk of your time doing unpaid work on open source projects you hardly care about? Yeah, iamverysmart syndrome guy, everyone is doing it too. \n\nApplying to junior jobs while having a giant list of portfolios that would suggest that you deserve to be a senior developer? Yeah, iamverysmart syndrome guy, everyone is doing it too. \n\n\"But but but I am sooooooooooooooooooooo smart, so I'll just double down and get even better! Hurrrr you see duuuude, what the market wants is experts, not code monkeys!\" Sure, bruh, whatever helps you sleep at night. Everyone is an utter moron and a chimpanzee/gorrilla except you. You are so special.\n\n----\n\nYou know what actually works in a congested market? Anti-competitive measures. That was how oligarchies form in a congested oil and gas market in post-Perestroika Russia, or Chaebols in South Korea, or Zaibatsus in Japan. We get acquisitions, price fixing, lobbies, special favors, even straight out state corruption. If you are not rubbing shoulders with connected people within the industry to help you bypass recruitment hell, don't count on you being magically smarter than millions of other software engineers on the market to get a job. No amount of leetcode gaming or resume cheating is gonna help you either.; Generally, I highly doubt crypto will play out to be a relevant competitor in replacement currency. \nI also highly doubt the US dollar is in any real danger of being overthrown in the short or medium term as the global currency. I just haven't seen data to suggest that and I work pretty closely to that world. \nMy assessment of the scenario is much more of a \"this is a transitory problem that will get better, but will likely take some time to do so.\" Not \"the US is nearing failure or loss of global relevance.\" There just isn't much data there to suggest that.; Politics has changed a lot globally. When I grew up most people didn’t identify themselves with a particular political party and they got mad at people/party power when they didn’t deliver. Now , politics is seen like a game and people have developed cult mentality and tolerate anything their side does and oppose everything other side does.  I am worried if US’s best days are behind it."

Take care of yourself. Then get an IT job, and then start developing your IT career.

How could I make myself screen \"hire me!\" ?\n\nI have no clue. You pretty much fucked all of that up when you decided to work in retail rather than make use of your degree for a decade.\n\nYou don't seem to think that that would warrant some sort of explanation, either - because despite asking for help, you aren't explaining it.\n\nThere is no magic ritual that can fix this, no secret wording to use on a resume to make that go away.\n\nany employer will have a choice between dozens of people with years and years of relevant experience, long stints at their employers - or you, with a long gap in retail, who got let go pretty much immediately after mucking about with wordpress for a bit.\n\nWho would you chose, given those options?\n\nDo you think the projects you plan in doing will be good enough to sway anyone's choice? Will they have users? Will they be innovative or unique? Will they demonstrate the skills that are expected of an experienced software developer?; I mean, I'm sympathetic to them and they can definitely take care of the pet.  What I got out of it, is they're bad at money management, have an inflated sense of self worth (look at the senior dev reply they made), and hit the absolute jackpot getting 100k with that level of experience.  \n  \nGranted it seems like they could have used more mentorship and such, but they were in a really good spot for entry level and didn't seem to notice that.; That’s 15% above median household income.

There’s no right or wrong there as it’s an individual choice, but the money is valued more in that case in lifestyle than savings.; When I first moved to NYC (in 2022), which is way more expensive than Austin, I was making $85k and managed to save quite well.; >inflation\n\n[Oh sweet summer child](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=e366935364740875&sxsrf=ADLYWIJWDtuWbdZpUv2yidjEkL6ebeGAsQ:1715214529965&q=great+recession+job+interview+line&uds=ADvngMhfMCis2xfsVx7Mx5zDY5TmI4SJcSjFgNhwFv0AxngWFcZIYbe1dY_pd1mka9BDuKnJrKp_3bldJDJx3clHEcplzOe5_zdkfhLsqPhWkI-AThBg0QSHP48j-mu5WzlUVDlAYo-qtsSNB1S4WASDGmqIFJVeTtmMWqqYYMf6bYZTRYMItNG1baF3aok9YFS5013_2yuwD-k3_tFnGSwRNN6mzt0uVkSlaW8HBwevltZsM2_94urg7DYwclynnNqWOXgxlqummJlGpgJl-L1NhQpcpPOOBGNBx-_FWzFC6uX4dDqHRLB3gsoVnliXaHf16wZYVRUesY7USH9DzJ6_qvxw-RzmotLwPWLw3U7fG5rmORDfn2I&udm=2&prmd=invmbtz&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjXkZaGqP-FAxWXxuYEHfuhDpkQtKgLegQIDBAB&biw=1778&bih=889&dpr=2); Work a retail job in the meantime for money. Spend the money on rent, food, water, and basic necessities like glasses. Then, in your off-time, network and sharpen your skills. There's nothing more to it, but your resume is not strong for software dev or IT, so you're going to struggle until you get your foot back in the door.; I struggled with that early on but I think that I figured it out but you won’t like the answer.\n\nFor me, the solution was not to settle.  At first, it was hard to say “no” to lousy job offers but I’d eventually get a good job offer if I waited long enough.\n\n(As an analogy …)  If you want a pretty girlfriend, you’ve got to say “no” to the ugly ones, no matter how lonely or desperate you are.  If you take what you can get and always settle, the ugly ones will get to you first, lock you in, eat up your time and energy, then dump you.  Then, you are even more lonely and desperate and the cycle repeats.\n\nIf you say “no, no, NO” to the ugly ones, even if you have no hope in sight to get a pretty one, you set up a virtuous filter.  The ugly ones don’t bother with you because you always say “no” so your “funnel” is either totally empty or has pretty ones.  You keep trying and failing to land a pretty one but, as you fail, you get better and better.  Then you land a pretty one and (if you switch back to jobs here), you make bank, save and then leverage your savings to be even more picky."

   "Top Comments": "I'm 53 and working on my masters finally. You are doing fine at 42. Just keep in mind ageism is a thing in our industry. It's sad and hard as hell to prove.; It's only dumb if you plan on dying in the next year or two! Ultimately it would be idiotic for you not to try this, down the line you'll kick yourself for not giving it a go! Go get your cs degree!; I know at least a half dozen developers who didn’t start coding until their forties and two  who got started in their fifties. There are some disadvantages to starting late, but you also have a lifetime of experience to pull on to give you a leg up.\n\nAs for AI replacing Jr. level developers, I’ll believe it when I see it. From what I’ve seen it’s a powerful productivity tool, but it’s far from being able to replace skilled laborers.; Degree in CS is good. Don't let the AI hype get to you, it will need to increase quite a bit before it can start doing entry level cs jobs.; I started my CS degree at 42. I'm five years on and have never been in a better position.; If you’re in a position to do it, go for it. I graduated undergrad with a humanities degree and then realized I was screwed for employment in my senior year, graduated, then stuck around campus to do a CS degree. However, I only finished two semesters before I got offered a job in consulting, which I felt like I couldn’t turn down. Well I ended up hating it and sticking it out because I had to for a decade. A couple years ago, my wife began a management position at a FAANG which allowed me to quit. I tried starting a restaurant, but covid torpedoed that.  \n\nI’ve recently been playing around with the idea of going back to school in my mid-late-30s and finishing my CS degree, which I really enjoyed while I was studying. It seems silly to some, but I feel like it’s the only way I could reenter the corporate world and not feel like I’m just doing bullshit.; I am a second career at age 58.  Graduated in 2021 with a Masters.  I think you should pursue a calling if this is what you enjoy.; Honestly this being 2024 is a much bigger issue than you being 42; CS degrees aren't useful for just becoming a programmer. In fact, the majority of cs graduates that I know aren't programmers. I have a friend that graduated with a CS degree and stayed in the IT side of things.  Today he is a director of information technology for a major utility company.\n\nI have another friend who when she graduated with her degree in CS she went into information security. She's been in that business for the better part of two decades and is very high up in one of the major consulting firms. \n\nI've got another friend who started his own cyber security firm and has grown it over the years. He's super successful. Another friend of mine used to see us degree to working devops for one of the major high frequency traders. I can't imagine how much money he's making. \n\nFolks on this sub are largely young and hyper focused on becoming software engineers. There's a ton of great options for you. Additionally, when you think about your average liberal arts / social science degree you have to realize that you would be qualified for virtually any job that someone with that degree would be qualified for plus all of the cs/tech jobs. \n\nThere are very very few bachelor's degrees that I could recommend as giving as much compensation as CS does. Electrical engineering would be nice, but the engineering majors are significantly more rigorous than computer science.  \n\nAnother option would be nursing. They have the potential to make bank, but you have to deal with all the stuff that they deal with.  There's a demand for new accountants these days but that's primarily because they pay accountants crap.; There has always been some boogeyman that was going to make software developers obsolete. Hasn't happened yet. I think it is always a good time to be going to school for a CS degree.; I finished my degree 2 years ago at 37. I got a job right away and I'm still there. It was 100% worth it. Went from driving a van to working fully remote for 30k more with truly unlimited PTO. Changed my life.\n\nAnd it cost me about 6k from a state school. And a few years of my life.; I want to do one at 56. I'm probably the insane one; No, regardless of the market, CS teaches you a lot about logic and efficiency; Are you hearing any of that from anyone who actually knows anything about AI (or coding for that matter)?\n\nIf you did they are trying to sell something but if not they don't know what they are talking about.  Writing the actual code is like 10-20% of being a software engineer, critical thinking skills and solving new problems is the rest of it.\n\nAI is nowhere near able to do the second part.; No.... The dumbest is not having to try at 42.., Trying is always the ‘Key’!; Dumb? Maybe, as long as you weigh the facts and are ok even if you don't end up with a job. Because tech is extremely saturated now and you have ageism on top, it's not going to be easy. On the other hand, you see nurses laughing about how they don't even need to get interviewed. They just get asked when can you start. It's like night and day between health and tech and they get paid similarly.; Nobody here knows the future, so I would first start at avoiding people on Reddit who pretend they are oracles. Realistically you are going to get a dozen anxiety riddled young people here who are in a headspace so far gone and they will only bring you into their negative orbit.\n\nI will say though, believe in yourself. If you can speak well, are likeable, and aren't afraid to network as hard as you hit the books, you will always have a paycheck.; Nah, not dumb at all.  I’m in my late 40’s and went that direction too.  I would say that ageism is dependent on the company and organization.\n\nAt my last job, a lot of the devs were between 25 - 60.  You just have to find the right place to work at.\n\nDon’t listen to these young kids who think they’re old and that their life is over at 23 when they’re not getting that SWE job right out of college.  They’re the ones who will tell you you’re being dumb.; As long as you are attending a regionally accredited university and not taking on crippling debt then getting a degree to change careers is a good thing.; I'm doing a EET diploma right now at 31 and I fully plan on returning to school for something else my early 40s. Maybe again in my 50s. Do your degree."

This after laying of tens of thousands of people. Have they no shame?; If hiring is so dire maybe they should… not layoff their current engineering staff?!?!; So the combined cost of their salary and green card will be less than the current position's pay. Which means the job will be worth even less and even more competitive. Great.; They have been abusing the h1b system for decades, and they now want to change the green card rule?; Labor shortages?  What about the 100K+ that got laid off this year alone.  Are all those people pariahs?; It’s sad that we have a large supply of qualified workers (in debt and in need of a job) only for these companies to import immigrants from India and take them; Can someone explain this to me? \n\nIs this separate from a normal green card that we know is there a special green card. \n\nI honestly thought once you get a green card and a big aspect of getting green card is that you aren't tied to your current employer and freely test out the market without visa limitation\n\nI was in a fortunate position where even tho I was born in India I grew up here in US since I was 6 and I got a green card around middle school and a full on citizenship at college \n\nCan someone if this is a different green card and also why this exists and it's not just another visa?; So companies lay off \\~80k tech workers this year alone (so far), then complain about a labor shortage?; They're right in the middle of firing a bunch of people...; I don't understand the article or the motivation or the comments.\n\nFirst they quote Microsoft as saying they anticipate a \"significant labor shortage(s)\" and mention that Biden may be considering such a rule change.\n\n>Citing its own research from LinkedIn, a business it owns, Microsoft anticipates significant labor shortages in fields such as software engineering, cybersecurity and data science.\n\nAt the same time we all know that even skilled individuals have a tough time getting a job and the competition is immense.\n\nAs it pertains to the rule change, some comments are pointing out that this is a good thing for folks from abroad because getting a GC sooner means they have more freedom to work for other companies and as such are less likely to be mistreated. Other comments are saying it's a kick in the ass of the domestic US workers because it's making it easier for companies to hire people from abroad.\n\nIt looks like... both are true? If the change makes getting a GC easier I can see how that means workers from abroad are less likely to be mis-treated and I imagine most reasonable people aren't against that. On the other hand if it makes it easier for companies to hire people from abroad that does sound like it could be a bad deal for domestic US workers, especially in the current climate. What's the debate about here, am I missing something?\n\nBtw, as an aside, that MSFT research statement feels like complete BS. Tech companies just laid off thousands of people and there are new prospective employees entering the market every year. I guess one could say there is a shortage of top-tier talent in the US already but again that's a strange argument to make. There are plenty of highly qualified, motivated and talented individuals already in the US and new ones graduate every year. Even then, they have the means to invest in up-skilling people if that's needed.\n\n  \nEdit: grammar and phrasing; Ah yes, more indentured servants imported to the US that corporations hold the almighty power of “kiss our ass or we send you back to the third world”. \n\nIf anything the Biden administration should be clamping down on this and supporting American workers, but we know that will never happen.; This is the type of shit people should be protesting over.  Every change these days screws over the American people a little bit more.; If you have a strong opinion on this matter you can add a comment here by may 13th: https://www.regulations.gov/docket/ETA-2023-0006/comments; I think this is pretty despicable considering they are laying off tons of american workers who could use this job and are trying to maximize profits by (probably) having these people work as corporate slaves for them.  \nSeems like there might be a way to comment on it?   \n[https://www.regulations.gov/docket/ETA-2023-0006/comments?postedDateFrom=2024-05-02&postedDateTo=2024-05-08](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/ETA-2023-0006/comments?postedDateFrom=2024-05-02&postedDateTo=2024-05-08); Paywall:\n\nMicrosoft, Google seek green card rule change\nTech companies struggle with green card sponsorships amid job cuts, but a proposed rule change, sought by the industry, could exempt certain tech jobs from labor market tests.\n\nAmid a series of layoffs, tech companies are finding it increasingly difficult to sponsor foreign workers for employment-based green cards due to stringent labor rules designed to protect U.S. workers. The process, governed by the Program Electronic Review Management system, mandates job advertising to ensure U.S. workers are not adversely affected.\nHowever, President Joe Biden's administration is considering a green card rule change that could significantly alter this landscape. The proposed exemption could be applied to a broad range of tech occupations including, notably, software engineering -- which represents about 1.8 million U.S. positions, according to U.S. labor statistics data -- and would allow companies to bypass some labor market tests if there's a demonstrated shortage of U.S. workers in an occupation.\n\nSpecifically, the Biden administration is looking to update the Department of Labor's Schedule A Shortage Occupation List to include STEM occupations. This list, which hasn't been updated in decades and is focused primarily on healthcare, exempts listed occupations from Program Electronic Review Management (PERM) requirements such as advertising job openings in newspapers, on the employer's website, at jobs fairs and other steps. Tech companies have latched on to the Schedule A list as a means to cut green card processing time and government regulation.\nMicrosoft, one of the tech leaders in Washington seeking tech-related immigration reforms, is lobbying for the inclusion of tech roles on this list. Citing its own research from LinkedIn, a business it owns, Microsoft anticipates significant labor shortages in fields such as software engineering, cybersecurity and data science.\nSimilarly, Google this week said it supports the Schedule A change, citing occupations \"critical to the U.S.' national interests,\" including software engineering, AI engineering, and privacy and safety engineering.\n\nLayoffs could draw interest\n\nThis push to change the green card rule coincides with companies such as Amazon suspending green card sponsorship programs due to layoffs and legal complexities.\n\n\"Due to government requirements for the green card process, we have temporarily paused our permanent labor certification program,\" said Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, in a statement to TechTarget Editorial. \"We're working hard to support [these workers] and find alternate immigration pathways as soon as possible.\"\n\nWhen layoffs are prevalent, the rationale behind these visas becomes questionable.\n\nThe tech industry has eliminated more than 80,000 jobs so far this year, according to industry layoff tracker Layoffs.fyi, complicating the green card hiring process that requires first seeking qualified Americans.\n\n\"The goal of employment-based visas and H-1B work visas is to supplement unavailable skills domestically,\" said Victor Janulaitis, CEO of Janco Associates, a labor market analysis firm. \"But when layoffs are prevalent, the rationale behind these visas becomes questionable.\"\n\nAmazon didn't detail which government regulation is a burden, but employers are required to provide notice to laid-off U.S. workers who are potentially qualified for job opportunities involved in PERM labor certification applications filed within six months of the layoff, under U.S. rules.\n\nCritics argued that the PERM process is often circumvented as employers might prefer to retain H-1B visa holders by transitioning them to green cards, sometimes at the expense of potential U.S. candidates. But trying to work around the requirements to seek a qualified U.S. worker can be perilous for employers.\n\nIn 2020, Facebook, now Meta, faced a lawsuit from the Justice Department, alleging it deterred U.S. workers from applying for certain positions. One such alleged deterrence was a Facebook requirement that U.S. applicants mail their applications. The company eventually settled for $4.75 million in civil penalties and up to $9.5 million to eligible victims of alleged discrimination.\nThe Labor Department's process for including occupations on the Schedule A list is unclear. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) is recommending use of objective labor market data, such as wage increases, vacancies and unemployment rates, to decide what tech occupations should join the Schedule A list.\nUpdating the Schedule A list with STEM occupations could remove requirements and significantly reduce green card processing times by 13 to 20 months, said Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, AILA's director of government relations. The green card process now takes more than 40 months with PERM, she said.\n\nThe U.S. plans to continue accepting comments on the proposed rule change until May 13.; Australian here: This is pretty bad news for tech workers and students in the US, just look what’s happening here.  Our government abuses the skilled visa program as well as our unis with 50% international students to drive down tech wages to the shitter. This results in tech wages here being half of what they would be in the US, so do anything u possible can to stop this and other bills like this from passing. Fun fact during Covid when our borders were closed meaning no immigrants, tech salaries skyrocketed by as much as 20k since u only had to compete with Australians and not half of the world; The labour shortage is a fiction. They just want cheap Indians; FUCK THAT."

   "Top Comments": "For PE firms, your salary is what you live on. It is rarely hyper stellar for entry and mid level, but can get pretty good eventually.\n\nYour bonuses for anything in finance are where you make the lions share of your profits. The reason for the structure is that it hedges companies against losing a ton of money on comp in lean years. \n\nAs a warning, most banks on WS and a lot of PE firms in 2023 had a median bonus payout of $0.; It's a similar environment to IB and AM in that you're a third class citizen and will be treated accordingly. Hedge funds / trading begrudingly offer more respect to SWE's. Worked in AM and had offers for IB. Would never recommend either. Big tech comp is far higher, and if being a swe in a financial space is what you want you'd be far better off joining a FinTech company that does third party tooling, or a trading firm if your leetcode chops are extraordinary.\n\nYou're going to have to review glassdoor to see how often bonuses are paid out or not, this heavily depends on the firm across PE. General rule with PE, AM, IB as a SWE is that comp is good but you pay for it in blood sweat and tears. You're back office so forget carry or any of the tales of obscene comp in any of those fields. Those 500k paydays are for the MD's and General partners who make it rain money. SWE is considered a major cost center.\n\n  \n Do your own research.; Do you have a source on the 2023 information?"

I do want to clarify, the code itself wasn't so much as broken or sloppy, it was just hardcoded into a plugin which means if the plugin gets updated, it all gets erased.  The code they didn't hardcore like that was actually solid, just dated (older PHP and jquery).  But still pretty cleanly written, especially by the professional company the boss hired at points. Well documented and actually had a pretty nice page written in early React. \n\nI think the way they had it was an amateur dev on staff who did the hardcoding and then they hired the professional company who added on to it rather than explain to the boss how bad that is. I can tell the difference in coding styles between the two and saw both in the plugin code. \n\nThey did also do weird things like have a taxonomy but then another custom table extending those fields (rather than creating a metabox for the tax), and then for some reason they also had it in another table just comma separated by the term\\_id.   \n\nUsing sports (which is not what we do), it would be like:\n\nTaxonomy (league) \n\nMLB (0)  \nNFL (1)  \nNBA (2)  \nNHL (3)\n\nThen another table to give them logos and other stuff\n\nAdditional Info \n\n0 - mlb-logo - # of teams  \netc\n\nThen if there was a player in the league, it would have a field:\n\n'Leagues' \n\n0,2\n\nMeaning they're associated with MLB and NBA\n\nSo I've also been trying to consolidate all that; Yes all before I joined and I was left to keep adding features to this while explaining it’ll crash if the plugin is ever updated.; what do you actually gain by updating the plugin in terms of tangible value u can explain to ur boss?\n\nif you can't explain it well, then you need to think about whether updating the plugin is actually in ur best interest; Well this was a while ago. I have since actually fixed it all and put the features into proper hooks. Unfortunately boss still wants more custom features that are getting harder and harder because it’s just a basic frontend dashboard not meant for tons of custom work. \n\nSo I finally talked them into just doing the dashboard from scratch and they’re upset it’s not done after a few work days; why would rebuilding everything from scratch be better?; Some things they just can’t have. The way it works is the shortcode allows you to place metabox groups separated by a comma. So I can easily put one group in one tab another in another or even two groups same tab. However, it’s limited by the group. \n\nBoss wants one field in one group to be displayed with another group. Which means if I put that field from group b to group a, it will probably lose all its data. \n\nAlthough writing a quick script to just transfer data will be quicker than re-writing the dashboard. \nWhile I expect in the future they’ll also want more changes / additions, but I’ve already done so much work putting them into the proper hooks (allowing a little plugin update), I wonder if I can just manipulate the positioning by adding classes to the fields and having css on the outside controlling it via a grid; Here is the brief summary of (one of) the problems. \n\nWhoever created the initial DB structure decided to split profiles into 2 tables. No clue why, but that's where we are.   Let's say table\\_a and table\\_b\n\ntable\\_a has most of the basic information on the profile while table\\_b is supposed to have more advanced profile information. \n\nBoss wants one field from table\\_b to appear with table\\_a data on the dashboard. That can either be done by just tacking it on at the end as I can't seem to group the two together to create a grid.  OR I can move the metabox field from group B to group A, then copy the data from table\\_b to table\\_a for that field. \n\nHowever, I will then have to go through the entire site and look for any instance of that field and re-do the DB query to pull from table\\_a instead. \n\n(btw, there is also a table\\_c and table\\_d in the dashboard, but those are built in a way that make sense to the site as they're mostly repeater and/or lookup style tables) \n\nRe-building the dashboard just pulling data directly from the tables will allow me to display them however I want and save to whatever table I want.   It's frustrating but seems to be the only option. \n\nThanks for helping me brainstorm a little!; seems like a classic data model migration problem at any company. keep at it"

They made a point of having everyone complete and receive a university stamped certificate regardless of how much they openly cheated. ; Because bootcamps in 2024 are legitimately scams; Could you imagine going to college for 4 years, doing internships, and not having any luck with a job search only to hear that a bootcamper got a job with a 6 month bootcamp and no internship? Even though these stories are becoming more and more sparse, it would definitely upset the former person.; short answer? they do not prepare the candidate for a job. As a result the candidate does not get hired. \n\nNo-one has nothing against anyone. \n\nIts the expectation vs reality that causes the issue. \n\nI sympathize with them. Paying 30k for JS and Python course is a scam. You cannot cram a whole engineering course in 3 months. Thats why people do not like that. \n\n  \nAgain. nonone hates or has anything agaist anyone. its just that the boot camp candidate's expecation is not meeting the reality. they are upset. In turn the time they spend with the hiring team, makes the hiriing team upset.; > I think people are confusing career prep bootcamps with coding bootcamps\n\nYes. \n\nMost schools have a career service that will tech what the bootcamps offer as part of a degree (resume writing workshops, interview workshops…). \n\nPeople confuse this with coding bootcamps that are, mostly, a predatory business (3 month, 20K of credit card debts to get instructions by a “graduate” instructor who did the same bootcamp 3 months ago?).; I graduated recently and completed one through a staffing shop (waiting on getting placed). Overall, I think it was pretty good since I learned a lot about Spring and Angular and can now build some pretty decent stuff. I would never pay to attend one though. You could get a whole damn CS degree for less than what a lot of them charge.; Mainly cash grab. Contributes to saturation of field. Higher competition for jobs. Barrier of entry is higher because, they’re trying to filter out bootcamp grads. I have nothing against it personally. I think that we shouldn’t lock technology away. There’s pros and cons to it. Highly situational based on the role’s needs, etc.; > bootcamp covered algorithms and data structures and LinkedIn, resume, and behavioral interview skills,\n\nAnybody can learn these for free without paying money; >Edit: to address multiple comments, I think people are confusing career prep bootcamps with coding bootcamps.\n\nMaybe they seem so against them because you communicate so poorly that you have to add an additional note explaining that you're talking about interviewing prep and no coding boot camps?; I don't think there's anything wrong with a boot camp that's going to give you skills that you can use to land yourself better places in life. \n\nThe problem with any of these boot camps though is that when people run to them as a substitute for getting a college degree in a field, like software engineering, it's going to be a bigger uphill battle for them to get into a good spot in the world. \n\nIt's why I told so many people with coding boot camps that they're going to have to do a lot of networking, do a lot of work on their own to build up and show that they are competent. Too many run to the boot camp, pass with a certification, and then find out they just have the bare Bones skills and are not at the level yet that hiring managers want. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with taking classes or doing something. If it's going to help you in writing resumes and doing interviews. Anything can help, but I would throw an ounce of cynicism in there until people that all the training in the world isn't going to guarantee them anything. You could be the most perfect candidate, and the company still might reject you over somebody less competent because they somehow see a benefit to them in getting that employee over you. \n\nI know from experience, I've seen highly experienced candidates rejected for mediocre candidates because the highly experienced candidate still comes at the higher end of the salary range while the mediocre candidate can go more towards the lower end. Granted the mediocre one won't do as good of a job as the highly experienced, but the company just doesn't care. Even if they are taking some losses because of this candidate, they will weigh the options between those losses and how much they are saving on labor. If they still come out ahead then they keep going, knowing this mediocre guy could eventually get better and they still get this person at less money. \n\nWe all want to believe that this is a world of merit. Where your experience and your resume and your attitude open doors. It's more like a game of chess where they are basically looking at you and weighing how much benefit they get versus how much you cost.; Most people I know who did boot camp do have non-CS degrees, like Biology, Chemistry etc.\n\nBootcamp helped them transition to tech, instead of getting second degree.; I know him, he's me.\n\nNo degree and made it, wasn't the only one either.\n\nThis was late 22/ early 23.; It's not a coding bootcamp. It assumes you already have a 4 year degree or equivalent experience.; Always have been\n\nedit: downvote me all you want. A bootcamp certificate is basically an overly expensive piece of letter paper with the way they never let anyone fail the course; Nah I don't like them because they are kinda scams and sell people on a false promise. For those that make it out with a job I'm happy for them.; I dont get this take, there are TONS of people working in tech without a degree. There are paths into the field without a degree. I decided to go to college, why would I be mad about a decision I made. I could have got some certs broke into IT then worked my way up to a 6 figure role and a lot do and are successful. I dont know why it would be any different when it comes to SWEs if you do a bootcamp you build your skills and you beat out the \"elite\" CS grads you deserve the job. Sometimes you have to open your eyes and realize that there is a reason most companies dont limit their talent pools exclusively to CS grads despite there being record numbers of them.; If you have a CS degree and you can't out compete someone who doesn't have one that's just a skill issue; Its not about CS vs bootcamp, its about that those who get the job with only a bootcamp they did it in the correct time before all the hype. It the same situation with Cryptos, if anyone and their dogs want to jump in and you see ads everywhere, it means that its late and the only ones making bank are the one who are \"selling shovels\".\n\n  \nNow people are late, there was no more 6 figure salary and fancy mocachinos, nowadays you will have to know a lot of things and have a good portfolio to have an opportunity."

It’s a way they can fire people without jumping through hoops; I strongly recommend getting career advice from people within your chosen career rather than family members and college professors (seen this one a lot too). Every industry is different.\n\nContracts are fine, they'll give you experience and a paycheck. Some places have contracts that are constantly extended because they need more employees than they're allowed to hire, pay for contractors comes out of a different budget. They'll convert these contractors to full-time employees after a while if they like them. Other places, contractors are project-based, they need someone extra for a project but don't need them after that. At my own company, contractors are treated the same as full-time engineers except they don't have access to the production database, but at other companies they might be treated differently. If you don't like a particular company/contract, you can always get another job and bounce.\n\nI'm not sure where you live, so I cannot comment on whether or not you'd be stuck in your contract. You should consult local employment laws and speak with an attorney if this is a big deal.; Why not try? That would depend on the terms of the contract, but I've never seen any penalties in a contract job for quitting early. Contract is just temp work. Go for it and if you land one make sure you read the terms and if it all looks good sign it, and keep looking for full time.; Your family is wrong.

What is your personal work? Are they not related to tech company?\nI got my degree on May 2022. I can't even get a contract job ; Yes; They are ok in the short term, but make sure you are making enough to offset the loss of benefits and don't get stuck in a rut of never earning any benefits as you get older.; Feels like I might’ve just wasted 1.5 years. I mean, it’s not like I got offers or anything. Today, I turned down an interview for a contract position, but that’s mainly bc the position was to test hardware, which is not at all what I want to do. I want to contribute and code - which I’m working on my skills on the outside. Also feels like college was a waste of time lol; That's also the thing, I'm not in a position for anything temporary. But if a job came along that's a 12 month contract, I'd be open to it. I'm just not knowledgeable on contract jobs enough to really give it thought. I need benefits and all that, which I know vary from job to job. I rejected a job today because of the position itself, but the pay was decent and it was a \"12+ month\" contract, it just had me thinking, really.; I’m at a bank as a teller, working to get into their IT department. I did recently apply to a position that I’ve been waiting for so I hope to hear back soon. Sounds like we’re the same age.; Well that's up to you. With the current job market I wouldn't pass on a contract job as a new grad but that's just me. Again like I said, you can always keep looking. As for benefits, it's not like you have any right now.; I do. I’m full time at a bank as a teller, working to get into their IT department. I just worry maybe that I’ve made a mistake in how I’ve done everything since graduating in 2022; The only mistake you are making is not taking an opportunity relevant to your field that was just given to you. You listened to your family who really doesn't have any idea what they are talking about in this case. It's the age of the internet, where you can get a lot of (much better) advice on forums like these, from people older than you who have been through it.\n\n\nAFAIK all but 1 state in the U.S. are \"at will\" employment states. This means anyone can let you go without notice and without reason. This includes the bank you work for. A 12 month contract working in the field, even without healthcare is a huge step up in my book. The difference in pay is probably worth the lack of benefits such that you can pay for healthcare out of pocket.\n\n\nAlso, you probably don't want to just turn down interviews. Give them a shot and get some experience interviewing. Then decide if you want to turn them down if you get an offer.; I’ll take this advice to heart as time continues. I appreciate it greatly, thank you; You're welcome and good luck! I've been there. It will all work out."

We are talking here about AI; >Doctors frequently come across things that do not fit into classifications well for whatever reason.\n\nAnd how do they handle such cases?\n\n>then you should be able to see that an LLM can do SWE as well.\n\nThe issue, is that SWE is about solving problems for which there is no known solution. Else, we'd buy the solution instead of developping it.; Usually they will have to consult with doctors in a different area of expertise, refer the patient to them, run different tests or draw their own conclusion from it.; At the individual doctor, yes. But that just means another doctor uses the same pattern matching techniques on a different training data-set to be able to classify that specific patient.; Hmm sure, but I don't think you give enough credit to doctors needing to draw conclusions from incomplete or unusual presentations of these things. \n\nAt the same time, I think you are giving a fair bit too much credit to what a SWE is doing.; What appears to be unusual might just be a rare but statistically significative nonetheless occurence in a large enough dataset. Incomplete is the hard problem to tackle here, as wrong data will give the wrong output (but that's a hard problem in every field). \n\nAn SWE's job is to start with an incomplete sets of goals and requirement and to engineer a solution around it. It's not about the coding as much as it is about the process of creative problem solving.; I could argue that what a SWE is similar to a doctor and given enough time a model could figure out which category these incomple requirements fit in right?; What an SWE does is more akin to researching treatment (there are no known solutions). \n\nI fail to see how the SWE job is similar to diagnostics, giving it's a classification problem (with a known number of different buckets that are illnesses). \n\n>and given enough time a model could figure out which category these incomple requirements fit in right?\n\nIt might be possible, would it help you to know what category your incomplete business requirements fit into? Can you give an example of these \"categories\"?; I'm not going to declare the categories, but I would imagine there is theoretically a limited number of \"genres\" that business problems fall into. Like if there are 20,000 different things that you just rearrange and put together. You know?\n\nI would also like to say your thoughts on what a doctor does is a bit incomplete.

   "Title": "Has anyone had a good experience with finding a new role in the current market?",
   "Top Comments": "I've said this in another post before but with 2.5 YOE, I haven't gotten a single response after applying to a few hundred postings for about 5 months. And I'm willing to take any job but can't get a single response.; it's a bad market right now, but doesn't mean it's a dead market\n\nit's just that horror stories get more clout than happy stories, we just love some drama; Laid off in December. I had zero responses from direct applications, but I was recently recruited for a fully remote role with a private medium sized profitable company.\n\n\n7 YOE. Unrelated degree. Interview loop was four interviews for the company, zero leetcode but lots of experiential questions about stacks and responsibilities. Around 200k total comp. ; Associate's Degree in Application Software Development. Had 1.5 years of experience as a Data Analyst right out of community college. I co-built the company's DB from the ground up and the beginning of their internal systems in C#/.NET with a friend who graduated with me. We were both let go when we asked for more fitting titles as developers. Him first in September, then me a few months later in December. Took my buddy one month to get an offer. Took me two weeks. Maybe we got lucky? But we both mass applied to newly listed positions (posted within a day and/or less than 100 applicants). Roughly 20 applications submitted a day. I got TONS of rejections, but also a lot of interviews. I'm not sure how much the market has shifted since the beginning of the year, but that same friend jumped to another company a couple months back. We're both making nearly double the salaries of our previous jobs and very happy.; I have 10 YOE and just recently accepted an offer.\n\nThe last time I job hopped was in the golden era of 2021. Overall it just took more applications to receive interviews. In 2021 I literally only applied to 10 companies, got 9 interviews, and a handful of offers. Took me 1 month from first application to accepted offer.\n\nThis time it took me just under 3 months, and I applied to 82 companies.\n\nInterviews with 9 companies. Ended up with 2 written offers, and one still in-progress that looked like it was heading towards an offer as well. I wouldn't necessarily describe the experience as \"awful\", it just took some more time than normal.\n\nTiming and luck play an important role in the job search as well. I didn't start talking to these 3 companies until early April. If I started my job search then, and these companies were in my first application salvo, the job search would've felt completely different, and only taken a month.\n\nThe one notable thing is salaries didn't grow out of control like they were previously. They were around what I'm making now *or less*. That's a reality check to some people, given the commonly parroted advice to get a big raise is to job hop. Not always true.; I started a new job a few months ago. Only casually interviewed at a few places before I landed this one with a ~15% pay raise. The process was a breeze, but this is a gov job which doesn't have as high standards/leetcode grilling as tech companies.\n\nIf the gov job and no leetcode didn't give it away already, I'm a C#/.NET dev; I have had a \"better than awful\" experience, but that's not saying much in this market. Applied to hundreds of roles, got around a 3% response rate. The bigger companies have so much leverage. I'd say the Sankey charts of hundreds of apps, majority rejections, ghosting, and then <5 offers total are pretty accurate. This market is a game of perseverance.; In the UK, entirely self-taught, no programming qualifications whatsoever. The 3rd job I applied for gave me a coding interview which I excelled in, and they gave me a job.\n\n\nThis forum is very US-centric, and I wonder if the job market is worse in the US.; I’m about to receive my MS in CS degree next week  (unrelated bachelor’s) and I just started a new remote job as a QA Engineer for $120k total comp this week. Recruiter found me on LinkedIn and I went straight into interviews until I had a job offer. Applied for 400 other positions and didn’t receive any responses. \n\nIt’s a rough market, not sure how I got so lucky.; I’m in the UK and just finished my degree. Didn’t have any plans in March, just to find a permanent job for the future and no more zero hour work.\n\nI applied for a handful of jobs, about 5, got an interview at one and they offered me the job same day. It’s nothing special, almost minimum wage but it’s close by and will be brilliant experience.\n\nEveryone here seems dead set on earning 100k as a grad, which is not feasible unless you’re a robot. I don’t spend much time doing side projects, but I have a good work ethic and work hard. I’m decent and communicating too, all of which are important.\n\nEmployers at average businesses don’t want leetcode robots, they want reliable staff who work well.; I have 6 YOE, changed jobs in early 2022. I’m not actively looking for anything new as I enjoy most things about my current role. With all the talk of how the market sucks, I was curious what my response rate would look like. I began scrolling through LinkedIn when I was bored looking only for roles that I would legitimately be excited about or be interested in and applying very infrequently. \n\nSince the start of the year I’ve probably sent maybe ~20 apps out. I’m not keeping track of exact response rates but I’d say 4 or 5 outright said no, 3 have had follow up of some sort. 1 was more specific questions about my level of experience. Another was a coding quiz “what would the output of this function be if given x, y and z”. Another was to schedule a screening call that happens later this week. The rest have ghosted. \n\nQuite a stark difference from when I last looked in late 2021/early 2022. At that time I had fewer YOE and I almost always got at least a screening call and I’d say over half went to final rounds. However I was being much less picky about the roles I applied to.; CS new grad, I was hired through campus recruitment 2 months ago and working fully remote as of right now. It took about 6 - 9 months for me after gradition to find a job.; I'm over 20 yoe and I wouldn't feel super confident of duplicating my current compensation in this climate. There are openings but a lot of employers are acting like slavery got reinstated.; About 6 months ago my startup shut down, in 3 weeks after about 20-50 apps, 15 strong ones I had 5 offers and got 2 more a week after I signed. 5YOE and I have a lot going for me (I know a lot of people in town, I have a solid background and I interview well); I've had more luck going through recruiters rather than cold applying. Use your linkedin network if you have one; Applying to anything and everything helped me.\n\nI've been applying for hundreds (maybe > 1000 didn't keep track) since October (when I found out that I wouldn't have a return offer). More than 10 referrals, and I got exactly two interviews from those. First one I failed in the screening round (was for a security dev position - not my domain), 2nd one was rejected in the very last round - they prioritized laid off candidates. \n\nFew more interviews from career fairs - one of those interviews didn't work out, and the rest of them (startups with < 50 people) indefinitely froze hiring. Got massively lucky with my current job (one of my spray-and-pray apps). OA, recruiter screening, 2 onsites (leetcode mediums/hards), hiring manager (behavioral + system design) all done within 2 weeks. Started the job a few days ago.; im graduating this month from uc berkeley. i mass applied on linkedin and handshake throughout the fall semester (500+ apps), and only got 2 interviews. felt like throwing applications into the void which caused me to lose steam and stop cold applying entirely. i reached out to employers from past internships and luckily one was hiring. there wasn't any online posting for the position. seems like a very relaxed gig. its hybrid with only 2 days a week in the office. $105K + some shares. im happy to be gainfully employed (at least starting next month), but it is discouraging to see how much more connections matter in this market.; Even in the boom times hiring was never a good experience. You still had to retype your resume, do technical rounds, etc.; Yeah and they aren't on reddit; [removed]"

   "Title": "How is my career as a Software QA doing?",
   "Top Comments": "If you have a job you are doing fine- try hard to keep it and don’t worry about progress in this horrible job market - in a couple years then think about changing jobs to get a bump, that seems to be the only real way to get a big bump and double your salary after 2 job hops - you should not stay anywhere longer than 3 years early in your career- when you get to senior level and up  it gets harder to stay and they get more PIP happy the higher your pay; Honestly I feel like after 5 years you should seek out a title increase (for resume) and pay increase. If you don't get both, I'd look into jumping ship to another company.\n\nI lived in rural Virginia and got my first job out of college as a software engineer for 60k in 2008. My 2 BR apartment was 800 a month and I had a roommate. I know QA doesn't make as much generally, but I feel like 65k is just not enough for someone who has been working 4.5 years. 4.5 years out of school in 2012 I was making 135k, albeit in a higher cost of living area. Many friends of mine were doing better than me. \n\nAlso have you considered shifting to development work? You could surely make at least your current salary in even a fairly junior role and could sell that you have extensive QA experience as a plus.; I'm QA as well (automation engineer, not manual tester), and I make 90k in a HCOL area with 2 yoe. I'm in Denver, so relatively similar to Austin in costs, so I would expect you to be able to shop around for a higher salary in your area, although it might mean giving up the remote job.; I've been in QA five years in the Kansas City area. My pay has been 55, 75, and now 115. First job had no automation. Hope that helps.; should be at 100k by now, but if you happy then why bother.; Wtf? You sat there for 4.5 years before worrying about getting a promotion??; that was my salary as a QA when I started in a MCOL city. At 4 years I was around 68k, but then moved to a different role for 70k then bumped to 86k at around 5 years.; I wouldn’t be surprised if a new hire at your role in your current company comes in at or around your current salary.; Bruther start applying like yesterday; That's normal, it takes effort to promote people, get approvals, budgets, etc.. and even your manager cant' promise it's a done deal, just that they will try their best.\n\nSo you have two issues, first Software QA Engineer has low marketability, sure it's needed, but you're competing with cheaper consultants. The second issue, can you get another job in Albany NY? I think you should be paid around 80K in the Albany NY market.; Sometimes HR can take a while for the promotion to go through.  But I would look at job hopping if you want a salary bump.  I work remote as a senior SDET and make 165k but before I made 130k, so the money is there.  4.5 years is a long time to stay as an associate, you should have enough experience to be able to make atleast 6 figures in a remote role; You should hop when it feels right make 90-115k as a mid level you shouldn’t bank on promotions internally.; It's not normal if you care about promotions. You should put in the work to get offers, and then you'll see what you're worth and what anyone is willing to pay you.; Why do you need approval from internet strangers?\n\nWhy do you need internet strangers to tell you what is normal?\n\nEither you like doing what you’re doing or you seek new and better jobs.; Op may live in Austin. But the company is in Albany, which I presume is a LCOL. So getting the big bucks on this job may not be likely. However finding a higher paying one locally in Austin sounds like a plan.; are you manual tester?; How did you move from manual to automation? What was the transition like?; Time flies. If you're comfortable, it's easy to just live life.; what are you at now? i'm at 80k working in data integration, thinking of swapping to swe or data eng if the pay would be better; How hard is SDET to learn? I know C#.\n\nSix figures as a QA Engineer?"

So, it's perfectly fine to say you want to switch careers because you want to make more money. This is your driver for career change.  In the current job market career change is the norm and not something exceptional anymore. The times people expend tens of years in the same company are over. Today the average employee is expected to change positions every 2-3 years.  \n\nDepending on the role you want to switch to, you will land or not as a \"junior\". Don't forget you already have an experience behind you. Have you identify the role or roles you would like to to transition to?; Yes, it's fine to say you wanted to aspire to more and provide a better life for your family. It's a good reason, and the truth.; Thanks, appreciate it and the snark.; Hey thanks for the reply. I am really interested in the defense industry and working as a Software Engineer at defense companies. The big 3 have locations near me but there aren't a ton compared to areas with a larger military presence. I was hoping to leverage my military security clearance to make me a little more attractive as a candidate. The roles typically call for C, C++, and Python.   \n  \nI'm still months away from graduating but I wanted to start reaching out to recruiters to break the ice and open dialogue to see what types of candidates they're looking for.; Thank you, appreciate the comment.; In that case you’ll need to move to where job opportunities are to have a chance to land a job quickly.

   "Top Comments": "This will really depend on what you're doing. But in general, the idea is that you are able to communicate the impact of what you do. So you'll need to work on understanding the context and scope of your work beyond just getting things done. \n\nSome examples I have:\n\n* I refactored a complicated import and ETL system that improved the import time for our customers from 4 hours to 60 seconds\n* Architected, led, and was the primary developer of \\[x\\] software. Created the MVP that still runs today and generates $500K annually\n\nSome stuff like that will be easier to know and document. Some stuff you'll want to reach out to find out, or keep your ear out for things. But that's a good thing. Having a greater understanding of how things interconnect is important.\n\nAlso remember not everything you do is worth or warrants quantifiable metrics on your resume.; As a manager I'd like to see LOC per week. A good developer has a high number.; Is this satire? Lol.; Seen this in a lot of secret performance reports in giant global companies. They just don't talk openly about it.; I guess my question is that loc doesn't translate to good code. I hope whoever is reviewing it looks beyond numbers and actually understands code/code based to some degree. I can push ton of crap out and solve task inefficiently and get high loc week. it doesn't mean it's good at all.; Good developer makes a lot of code. Deleting isnt good."

As you said, you won't get paid for any days off, so you got to balance the money you're going to miss out on and also have to make sure you're still able to complete any assigned work.; It’s up to you. One day off a month is -5% pay for 20 work days. You get sick, that’s another -5%. I wouldn’t be planning any days off for months if I were you. Get ahead of your expected time off first.; Why don't you talk to them about it like a big boy?; Contractor and W2 are a contradiction - W2 means regular employee.  Are you a W2 for a contracting firm?  If so, you need to check with the contracting firm about PTO, since the firm holding the contract won't be paying them for any days you miss.; Yup, W2 for a contracting firm. They don’t offer PTO btw.; Then you're going to need to decide how many hours you can miss in a month, because any time you miss will come off of your paycheck.  However, the firm that holds the contract can also be a player here - they may be open to you working extra on some days in a week to make up for time off in the same week."

YMMV; Are you even a software engineer if you haven't been fired, laid off, put on a performance improvement plan because of politics at least all 3 once ahah\n\nDon't worry no one will care; Re: mild depression: I sort of had a similar thing.  I was in my late 40s at the time and I was sick and tired of what employers wanted.  I said, “What do I want?”  I made a plan to do stuff (e.g. open source, learn a JS framework, write a sci fi novel) that I wanted irregardless of whether employers wanted them or not.  If I had a job, I did my stuff when I felt like it.  When I didn’t have a job, I did my stuff full time.  I felt a lot better and felt mentally stable having “my stuff”.; Haven't been fired but I'm in my 40s currently going through depression and severe burnout.\n\nMy hunch is that, it's not you, it's the depression. Take care of that first. It clouds your judgement and your self perception. Working with a career coach might also help, that's what I'm doing.\n\nYou don't have to start over. You'll be able to bounce back. Don't listen to what your depressed thought are telling you. Get a therapist.; Have about 20 years experience in software. Been through 2 layoffs the last 4 years (and one where a grant wasn’t renewed but the others due to offshoring) with the most recent being in November 2023. Was able to get 3 offers in 2.5 months with no drop in compensation and all wfh. Just keep grinding the interviews and you’ll land something.; I was laid off in 2008. It ended up being a huge positive for my career because I founded a startup shortly after. That startup failed, but I learned a lot and co-founded another 2 years later that ended up being successful. I did contract work on the side to pay the bills in the meantime.; Mid level engineer who is about to be laid off. Luckily with some FU money squirreled away, I’ll use this as an opportunity to decide what’s next. I’m thinking about starting my own business in something I have no idea about (I have SMEs available though) but it is something that would help kids with autism. I want to do something meaningful instead of enabling someone to pay their private jet gas bill. \n\nMy other choice is to move out of tech and into a stable but lower pay sector like healthcare or state/federal. I have a family so this would provide stability for the coming years and low stress for the most part. \n\nWho knew adulting could be so annoying.; I don’t think I know anyone who got laid off and took a worse role. In fact, I know a dude who I hated working with at a big tech company. Guy was senior but I never saw him do shit other than ask questions in technical design docs that were way out of the scope of the project just to make himself seem smart. He was almost never online and idk how he made it to senior, but I guess it made sense since he was senior for like 5 years so he was just coasting. He got laid off. Then he got a staff position at another big tech company. Got laid off 6 months later. Got a senior staff position at another big tech company. Dude probably tripled his TC by getting laid off twice in 6 months.; Bounced right back. Better comp, better job. Took three months. I think the idea that you need someone to teach you will just hold you back. Develop strategies to teach yourself and prosper. You cannot afford to wait in software you need to be the one self learning the latest developments in your niche, especially when unemployed ; I got fired once. I was younger then, just about 30 years old. Luckily I had been looking around already. I had to accept a job with a startup at the salary they were offering. That gave me some time to do a proper job hunt to find the ideal job.\n\nI would not read too closely in the \"looking for someone with more experience\" feedback. If you are already mid to senior level, that seems like a strange take. While it may make sense to learn from failed interviews, I think it could be hard to get all the real details for the rejection.\n\nThe job market really sucks now. For seniors, sometimes it might take a really long time to find another great position, even when the job market is healthy. So as long as you can nab interviews, I'd say you got to keep applying and hope you get lucky. Then accept whatever you can get for now.; This is a reassuring post.; >however I feel that for the seniority level I'm at, it's difficult to learn some things without working along a senior developer. \n\nWhat things are you talking about??; Glad you are in a better spot now! How long did it take you to get your current job?; Seems I’m on the right track then lol; Oof, I must be lucky then; A good man’s never out of work if he’s worth a damn.

I.e., you don't have to be Hispanic / Latino to attend conferences targeted towards that demographic. Employers won't care.\n\nYou can interview and receive a same day offer from major organizations such as Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed, Northrop, and possibly Google, Microsoft, and so on.\n\nIn these cases, they are very specifically looking for entry level students, and *want* to hire you. As a veteran you will be a hot ticket for defense companies, and a preferred applicant for most companies, both just because you are a veteran, and because veterans have desirable backgrounds.\n\n- Internships often lead to full time roles. As a veteran you'll be a hot ticket, especially for defense companies. They also look good on a resume for potential employers even if they're not who you interned for. Having 2-3 successful internships says a ton.\n\n- Research often establishes valuable connections and looks good on a resume.\n\n- Professors often have industry connections, and if you nurture a good relationship and maintain a high academic standing, they will write letters of recommendations, put you in touch with people, and generally go to bat for you.\n\nMoreover, the time invested to build such a relationship is tiny compared to what you get out of it both academically and professionally. \n\nAsk good questions. Ask questions *beyond* what is covered in class. Ask about their research. It leads to a professional / personal relationship.; Sounds like this is full time? If so, I would focus your first year on learning CS fundamentals and figure out what you want to do. \n\nTo fully utilize college, make sure you know every single thing it offers. Extra curricular stuff (competitive programming, security competitions, etc), career services, mock interviews, job fairs. Everything. You don’t get these things after graduation, so use them. \n\nYour main objective for your last two years is internships as those aren’t really available post graduation. Ask career services for help. Ask your CS professors for help. Get to know your fellow students and you will learn from them, too. \n\nIf you go the software route, certs don’t really matter. I wouldn’t bother. If going security or IT, ask your professors or any further-along fellow students. \n\nI would mostly focus on getting the most out of college itself instead of trying to add monetary value to the bill. \n\nDon’t be afraid to make some sacrifices. I work full time remote now. Cushy job, yet also cutting edge tech and plenty of challenges. But I wouldn’t have gotten here without those exhausting programming competitions I didn’t have a dream of winning, my shitty QA internship, shitty year of a 50 minute commute, and shitty interviewing for something better at each step along the way (even when I already had it good).; Congratulations! I’m 35, just graduated, and start as a junior developer in June. \n\nRead the textbooks! You can find answers to all the fundamental stuff in them. Some of my professors followed the textbook to a ‘T’ while others lectured at a level higher than what the text offered, but in both cases the textbook clarified concepts that I didn’t understand the first time around. \n\nIf your school offers peer tutoring don’t hesitate to go. Tutoring helped me get through data structures and algorithms and other math courses. \n\nWhen looking for a job look for companies or government agencies that have veteran hiring initiatives. They will get you interviews and potentially jobs. \n\nDuring interviews lean into your experience being in teams. Potential employers want cohesion not antisocial individuals. I’m no 10x coder or CS wiz but I am good with people and that has served me well before my switch to tech and going forward. \n\nGod speed! You got this.; Your situation isn't as unique as you think. Most of the time you'll be balls deep in your actual curriculum.\n\n1. Your \"core\" education classes are going to be boring and you need to just fucking DO them.\n2. If you suck at math, like, dyscalculia learning disorder bad, then you should look at a B.A in CompSci, or go CIS route.\n3. Don't fuck off too much in your CS classes - the info is actually important (unless it's a long winded lecturer).\n4. There are a TON of Full Stack gigs available right now, and probably will be that way for a decade or so. Take a full stack elective after you've learned your foundational CS stuff (web dev, data structures, algorithms, object oriented).\n5. Learn how to lightly fuck with Machine Learning and AI (Iris flower image recognition, neural net training, LLM deployment, RAG), but don't worry about learning a ton of Python or the data-science aspect - save that for a Masters degree.\n6. Try your very best to become proficient at Linux (Debian or RedHat) and C++, a LOT of companies existing code is in this type of setup. \n\nHaving a military background is fucking CAKE my guy. DoD contractors are always hiring programmers that can a) pass a drug test and/or b) get their S/TS clearance.; Pay attention in class.  Your one advantage over younger students is that you're there to get crap done and not experience the \"college life\" so to speak.  Take notes and read the assignments.\n\nTake a Software Engineering class.  If it is taught correctly it will prepare you more for real world programming than most theoretical stuff in many CS programs.\n\nTake a Databases class.  Understanding how a database functions will help you immensely.  A vast chunk of software out there in the online world interfaces with a database of some type to store its data.  Don't stress \"no-SQL\" databases for now, once you understand relational databases they are easy to pick up.\n\nTake a Network programming class.  Being able to understand how to send and receive data over a network is fundamental in the day and age where we live on the internet.  Understanding things like DNS, IP addresses (v4 and v6), subnets, ports and sockets, and at the higher end, webservers and so forth will give you a lot of helpful knowledge.\n\nTake an Assembly language class.  This gets you programming at a super low level, sending instructions directly to the processor and manipulating data in registers.  This low level knowledge will prove helpful in understanding how higher level languages do things.  If this really fascinates you, consider taking a compilers class.\n\nIf you want to go in that direction, take an Operating Systems class.  Understanding how your computer actually runs from boot to handling each program running on it is really useful if you are building things to run on an OS.\n\nAsk questions and go to your professor or TA's office hours.  If there are study sessions, try to attend those.  If there are labs, definitely attend those.  If you're stuck on something, ask your TA or prof.  You can also ask them for input or guidance on things like interests or career paths.\n\nProgramming takes *time*.  Start your projects or assignments early, ideally as soon as you receive the assignment.  Early and beginning class assignments will not take as much time to get done, but this will give you time to make mistakes and learn how to actually program.  The last thing you want to run into is an assignment for a project you started 8 hours before it was due and get stuck on some weird bug that you spend 7 hours trying to work around and don't turn in the assignment on time.  This is especially true for higher level classes where an assignment can take weeks to build and put together into a functional system.  You cannot \"slap together a program\" like you can write a paper and expect it to make passing marks.  This is one pitfall I see a lot of students make.\n\nIn the same vein, understand what the assignment is asking you to do.  Read over things carefully.  If you're not sure, ask your TA or prof for clarification.  You don't want to build a program that does A only to find out it's supposed to do B.\n\nAt some point, read through and practice the content in https://missing.csail.mit.edu/.  This may be overwhelming in your first year, so don't sweat it if it doesn't make a lot of sense at first.  Revisit it as you gain more knowledge and experience.\n\nDon't be afraid to make mistakes and break things.  Learning how to fix broken things in programming is a very large part of being a good programmer.  Learn how to use a debugger (depending on the programming language).  If something breaks, look up the error message.  Figure out what it is telling you.  Purposefully write a program that does something wrong and see what happens, then fix it.  One of the earliest classes I had in programming was us spending time writing incorrect programs so that we could recognize how it wasn't working, and learn how to fix it.\n\nLast of all, back up your data.  Keep a working copy of your work in progress on an external drive or something.  Once you learn it, make heavy use of Git and GitHub with private repos.  You don't want to lose all of your work and have to start over from scratch.\n\nI have a MS in CS and over 20 years of industry experience.  Feel free to ask if you have questions!; [deleted]; Also to add I honestly haven’t decided exactly what I want to focus on. I obviously would like to make more money but what’s most important to me is a good work/life balance. Being able to take time for my family is very important to me. \n\nIf anybody has any suggestions as far as actually chasing a career and if there’s anything I should focus on for it while in school as well would be appreciated. \n\nGot the opportunity and jumped head first into it to be a college grad at 31 because I’m tired of the long hours and traveling of labor. But I’m trying to be as prepared as possible. Thanks again.; Take advantage of all the internship and job opportunities that are only available to college students.  Being a vet will give you a leg up on almost all of those opportunities. Being a vet and an adult will make the college experience easier as well because you'll treat it as a job vs incoming high school students who won't be as dedicated to success.; Considering how the market is right now, I would say think long and hard to see if you still want to get a CS degree.; I had a similar situation where I started at 27 and just finished my CS degree at the age of 31 last December doing online classes. Are you interested in programming and been practicing already or just looking to get into tech such as IT as well? My first year and a half had me working full time, and some overtime up to 55 hours a week, while doing part time classes. It was pretty brutal and I was lucky since I had practiced with C++ for a year before doing college which let me coast through the first year of classes.  Will you be working on top of classes or using something like BAH?\n\n  \nHow good at math are you now with things like algebra? I was a math wiz back in high school and algebra used to be super easy. After being away from school for 10 years and going back, my math skills deteriorated and my brain didn't work like it used to. I had to slog and grind my ass off to pass math. You'll need to be prepared to put in the hours, I was doing nearly 80 hours a week with work + school and was lucky that I didn't have a family to take care of on top of that. Be prepared to do internships, I absolutely shot myself in the foot by ignoring them since I just wanted to get my degree as fast as possible. \n\n  \nUnless you really want to be a dev and willing to put in the hours, I would suggest a alternative. If you are fine with going the IT route, you could probably save time by getting certs instead.; Take all the electives you can while you're in college. Make sure you code little projects in your free time, preferably starting before you start the degree.; 4 year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, from a college with an accredited program, will give you the best chance at having a career relevant to this sub.\n\nAs someone else said, internships are important, as real job experience helps land the first interviews and can help build a network of people to maintain your career.; As for high tier laptops, I really enjoy the new silicon chipped mac books.\n\nI was always a PC guy but started using macs for work.\n\nWent back to school at 29 and bought a m1 max mbp. It's a great laptop for school and really anything else.\n\nIt's super fast, super quiet and has amazing battery life.; Internships; Check out what languages you'll be using in your program's intro programming & Object-Oriented Programming courses. I'm assuming you're starting in the Fall, so if you spend some time getting familiar with the fundamentals of the languages you'll be using in school, you'll be better off when you start. I imagine you'll start with C++ but it can differ from school-to-school. \n\nApply to internships early and often. Use [Jake's resume template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) and have your resume reviewed (anonymize it, tho) on /r/EngineeringResumes/ and/or at your school's career services center. I'm not sure how clearances work but I imagine you have one, or can get one easier b/c you're a veteran. Apply for internships at government ([USA Jobs](https://intern.usajobs.gov/search/results/) is a good place to start) and defense companies. \n\nGo to office hours and tutoring, make friends with motivated, like-minded people and discuss the material with them. \n\nBest of luck!; The \"accepted\" part is an illusion to make it seem like they were the ones picking you.\n\n\"Fine, you win, congrats, we will allow you to pay us thousands of dollars a month\".; Congratulations!!!! You got this; Don't get lazy if you use copilot/ chat GPT. If you asked it for something and you don't know what that code does ask it to explain that line. And check the reference link. Copilot often links to the stack over flow it took the answer from; Since you're a veteran you'll have an easier time getting clearances and sometimes jobs/roles at Defense/Govt companies/orgs. \n\nStart networking asap esp with any leadership you might be in contact with already.; Practice makes perfect.\n\nLearning the Theory is great but practicing helps you master it. \n\nData structures and OS are two hard courses in this major but reality is if you practice what you learn you can pick it up and make it not so daunting."

   "Top Comments": "People tend to get typecast in a role or being the 'Go to person' for a particular task, its possible you are the bug fix person.\n\nWhen i was lead i had to continually challege the BA's and PM's to spread the difficult or new tasks around the development team otherwise the same developers time after time would get picked.  Their argument was always 'X has done this before, so it will be quicker if i give them the task'.  Most of the time all they care about is delivery speed which is wrong as it prevents upskilling of the rest of the team and creates a 'Key person' dependancy.; Depends. I personally do not see bug fixes as \"scut work\". Sometimes fixing bugs are the most challenging part of software engineering. Sometimes, I would only exclusively do bug fixes for weeks because we are getting close to release.; Really depends and hard to say.  I've been at this for over 30 years and I still fix bugs and other problems that crop up, not because that's all I'm good for, but because the younger devs don't know how (or won't even try) to resolve these issues.; Have you spoken to your manager about it?; I'd start by chatting with your manager again.  \n\n* Outline what you've observed about your assigned work (maybe even bring some stats to the table)\n* Try to ascertain from them whether there's a reason (maybe they think you're especially good at fixing bugs?)\n* Let them know that you'd like to be able to leverage more of your time with learning new tech and implementing new features to get more of a balance \n* Emphasize that this will enable you to create more valuable contributions to the team.  \n\nTheir response will probably give you an idea of whether you should think about leaving.; It really depends on the particular application, but in a lot of the projects I’ve worked on fixing bugs was harder than adding new features. Being able to quickly diagnose a problem and find the cause in a large code base is a skill and requires a lot of understanding that junior engineers just don’t have. I’m doing a lot of mentoring lately, which is new for me, but it’s really opened my eyes to how much I take for granted certain knowledge and skills that have naturally accumulated over my career. I have quick answers to random problems because I ran into those problems or similar years ago. So it could be that they value your experience and ability to solve critical bugs.; Maybe bring it up with your boss that you've learned the new stack and you're ready to do tasks beyond just bug fixing?; What happens when you talk to managers about it? Or when you push back? Etc. \n\nFinding a new job isn’t the answer to all of life’s problems, believe it or not.; Try to make work you want to do. Make a project that can improve the business or improve developer efficiency. Propose it, get buy-in, and climb.; How long have you been there? Can you even get a better job offer? How much experience do you have as a dev? How good are you as a coder? Why would they give you better projects/work?; I would try communication first and then based on the results of such communication make an informed decision on whether it's time to move or not.; Bug fixing is the way many people learn. I wouldn't read anything into it.; >Im an older dev changing stack, so back at the bottom of the pyramid\n\nWhat have you done to prove that you can deliver for the team, the company?\n\nWhy should the team give you any important tasks, if you admit that you're at \"bottom of the pyramid\"?\n\nAre you able to knock out the bugs left and right, solve all the problems with speed and delivery, that can impress the team?\n\nHave you gained lots of domain knowledge by solving all the bugs?\n\nCan you use the insight from fixing all the bugs to deliver impact solutions?\n\nThere are gold and diamonds in every task.  All you have to do it pick them up.; OK, couple of things:\n\n1. Are you really good at fixing bugs?  Might be that the rest of the team sucks at fixing bugs and you're helping them move a lot of dirt.\n\n2. How long has this been going on?  It might just be that they have a lot of bugs and see #1.; INFO: How long have you been there?; In that case and with what OP says, doesn't OP's case seem to be a PM/Lead issue, meaning it might actually be time to leave?; Everyone wants everything done yesterday at the same time and it’s exhausting.; [deleted]; 14 months.. probably get a similar offer as had a few to choose from for this role\n\nI have 14 yoe but maybe only 2 are close to this type of work.. I am mediocre as a dev in this stack.. they should give me better tasks so the team can skill up symmetrically; I was lead in another software industry and spread tasks symmetrically regardless, thats how you upskill a team and have cross-redundancy rather than create silos"

Microsoft might have better career growth but it’s going to take one promotion minimum (obviously) to get back to your previous salary. Just my two cents; How much stock?

I wanna change companies and want to know how is it going.; I got this email from google, but I have no idea how they got my email. The email was basically about submitting interest for a possible internship position and to tell me to update my Google Careers profile. I didn't apply to any of their positions before, and my linkedin profile is half baked, I don't think anyone could generate an interest from just that. The email itself looks legit. I risked catching a virus and clicked the interest form link they sent me, and that looks legit as well. Do they just do this often?

My boss has zero trust in me because I haven’t quite gotten the subtle communication style that this keep speaks in (i.e it’s always someone else’s fault and you never actually say the quiet part out loud).

If it’s Seattle and Amazon then do that.\n\nETA: Formatting; Graduate? From where with what my god; No job security with Elon companies; SpaceX is wack. Long hours and 5 days a week in office; Can't imagine what the culture is like under Elon. Amazon seems to be the better pick.; No amount of money would convince me to work for Elon Musk.; Better future prospects with a faang so go Amazon. Start networking when you get there. Seattle is great!; 184 TC for new college grad? Are we talking top school with top grades? Because that's insane.; A tiny counterpoint to the anti-SpaceX vibe.\n\nEarly career, you can handle bad WLB.  You have the energy and spoons to actually care about passion projects, you probably don't own a lot of stuff and aren't really tied to any specific area. This is absolutely the time in your life to go out on a limb and work a \"cool job\", because realistically you'll never get another time.\n\nYou don't have family at home, you don't have nuanced hobbies developed, you're free time is probably either getting partying or playing video games depending on where you fall in the social life spectrum. You don't have big responsibilities, don't know yourself that well, and you do have a desire to explore and discover yourself. This is the one time in your life where you're not going to hate yourself for working late on something you think is really cool.\n\nDisclaimer: this doesn't mean you accept abuse. This doesn't mean you shouldn't strive to have great WLB in your workplace, or that you should accept companies exploiting their \"cool factor\" as a way to abuse juniors. Ideally you work somewhere cool and high pressure that also respects you as a member of a company. I'm simply illustrating that right now is the time in your life where you shouldn't be afraid to jump headfirst into a truly engaging challenge, because you can afford to and the experience can be incredibly valuable. Just remember to get back on the boat and float with everyone else when the time is right, lest you be left to drown when burnout hits.\n\nIf you really think SpaceX is cool, and you'd really love to live in LA, and you really want to work on cool shit, work at SpaceX. Even if the WLB sucks, even if the pay is worse. You'll be glad you did and not many people can say they put stuff in space. You definitely won't have the spoons/energy/ability to work on \"cool jobs\" later in life. But if you're not actually that into it, then don't feel guilty about doing Amazon either. Honestly the WLB in amazon isn't dramatically better or anything anyways.; Take amazon. Screw elon musk; Congratulations.\n\nI would take SpaceX"

   "Title": "How does one become a BA?",
   "Top Comments": "\"BA\" is a big title.  I'm a solution architect, i have two kinds of BAs under me.\n\nAt my current job, for example, there are \"BAs\" (Business Analysts) that's basically a social role - their job is to interface with the business on a regular basis, know what leaders want, how life is going for workers, and to keep an ear on the industry and our vendors and to interface between the tech team and the business side.  They should have a good functional understanding of the system, but it's really about organization, planning, communication.  So, if there is a new regulation, it's the BA's job to find out about it in time for me to do something about it.  Likewise, if I can only offer say, one of two imperfect solutions to a problem, the BA (usually) is stuck getting the business leaders to decide which to do.  As I said, the main skills are communication and organization - a common path is tester -> test lead -> BA (-> PM) or coming from a business or white collar job, but with a solid track record of fastidiousness. \n\nThere's also the *technical* BA.  They have two main jobs - the first is to interface with the business BA to convert various minor complaints into technical stories for JIRA - this includes handling vendor-supplied patchs.  The second is to keep tabs on the developers, make sure they're on track and aren't facing blockers.  Basically the tBA is my Executive Office - I can tell the developers what to do, and thanks to the tBA, i can trust it will happen without having to keep tabs on them.  tBAs are typically CS/IT people with good social/org skills who realize that they don't want to be coders or are just generally not super techy.  Typically they would later become a PM or IT manager.; The first step is to understan what the BA role requires looking at LinkedIn BA job offers. From there, you can figure out the gap separing your profile from those roles in terms of skills, experience, and education. There are also career simulators like this one [https://www.mysmartcareer.site/](https://www.mysmartcareer.site/) that can give guidance in those roles. Once you have this information, you have a more clear idea what to do next  like: Applying for jobs and at what level, learn something, or reskill yourself. If  you want, share the career simulators results to figure out how you can get what it need to get into the BA role. \n\nCertification are interesting if you have a prior experience in the domain, otherwise, recruiters consider certification as a knowledge not helping you to get the job.; What does BA mean?; That's really helpful. I knew what BA does, but interesting take that they come up from QA/Testing rather than Devs.; Business Analyst iguess"

If they question you then tell them you are an intern and learning how to do the job. This way you learn something and you get paid. \n\n\nIf you really want to do the work, choose stuff that is used the most as youll have the most online resources to help you if you do that. ; You're not an intern you're a dev.

Shadcn has a pretty nice one. Then I would choose a component library. Shadcn would be the way to go if you use their dashboard template. Tailwind UI component library is pretty good too, but it is paid. Component libraries will save you a ton of dev time. \n\nFront end framework is up to you. React is popular, but I prefer Svelte or Vue.; Some companies use interns to build their MVPs. Look up Joshua Fluke internship on YouTube lol; It depends. How is your pay?; Sink or swim type moments, try to look into different tech stacks and see what fits best.\n\nSituation like this will force you to learn, you’ll come out with some great skills after trialing different things.; are they paying you? its not an internship its just low pay or no pay job instead of hiring an employee.; Sometimes working on a real world project by yourself can be a great way to learn. Just remember to check in with the users to see if what you're making will work for them day to day.

Then, you can find a place where you'd enjoy a senior role.; You can find seniority in systems programming. I'm not sure who told you otherwise.\n\nDo what _interests_ you the most. You'll do the best there, and have the most impact. And that's what you're ultimately graded on as a senior IC.\n\nAlso, I don't understand the false dichotomy you've constructed. Big-name web companies have vast armies of engineers doing \"systems\" work. It's not all web stuff, not even close.\n\nYou wanna do compilers or perf engineering? A place like Meta or Google is your best bet.; Hi, I see you active on this sub a lot. Nice to have you comment on a post of mine lol.\n\nYes, I understand that big-name companies have people doing systems work. What I am saying refers to what entails success as an engineer in each branch.\n\nI interviewed at several teams at big names this year that do stuff close to the metal. Each of these interviews was vastly different. I was asked to do everything from polyhedral loop optimization to optimize memcpy based on different ISA's. I failed most of these because for one reason or another, I didn't answer that critical question - \"why should we hire you over someone else\" because why would you hire an autodidact from a no name school like me over someone with an academic background and the corresponding know-how?\n\nAnd so, I'm wary that the barrier for finding seniority is much greater working on systems-level stuff. I also think that it's very sparse - as a graphics guy I'm sure you know that it's very different even from similar fields like embedded systems or finance. I also think that web roles are more lucrative by virtue of scale. One can lead and architect entire web backends, and there is demand at the top companies for the top 1 percent who do it best.\n\nThat kind of ecosystem doesn't really seem to exist (?) for systems talent. As much as I enjoy learning about compiler optimization, parallel architecture, advanced C++, no systems developer is owning a compiler or AV collision system on their own.\n\nFurthermore, advanced systems is gatekept under grad level coursework and I don't go to the best school. I can keep up with top students with leetcode but what many learn in class I read books for. My school doesn't even have a distributed systems course.\n\nSo yeah, sorry for worry-dumping. But I feel out of my element every day despite loving systems work and I question whether I am making things hard on myself for nothing when I could have graduated earlier and gone to work for any of the web offers I had (opportunity cost rip)"

You'll be immune to outsourcing & command \\~15-25% higher salary with significantly increased stability.; Hey OP,\n\nI’m a mil guy who transitioned into defense contracting. \n\nI don’t know what you have going on but I would look into the guard and reserves. I can speak those very well if you have any specific questions; Air Force vet (and now Reservist) here\n\nPlease join Air Force or Navy if you do this, those are your best bets to stay “close” tech with lower odds of being in a combat role.\n\nThat said, if you join any branch, you can say farewell to any plans you make and Uncle Sam won’t give a shit about what you want to do. The military is all about what you make of it.\n\nFrankly, I think you’d be better off as a Reservist (either Air National Guard or Air Force/Navy Reserve). Get the exposure, maybe get a clearance, serve your country and expand your career. But if you go active duty, no guarantee you get the job you want. You could end up sitting on a flight line for 16 hours or cleaning toilets for 4 years.; I would go back into the Navy in a heartbeat if I was young enough and not all busted up.; No one really talking about the fact that OP seems to be doing this mostly for job security, which makes little sense to me. Ultimately the objective of job security is financial security, but I think potential earnings difference between military and civilian jobs is so great that the former shouldn't be considered for this purpose unless OP is already earning significantly below median.\n\nBest move I think is to tighten the purse strings and aggressively pursue higher paid roles in the private sector. Seems like less trouble than military life.; I'm a vet and a senior developer. This is not the way.  I held a secret clearance, but only because I had to type up all the officers paperwork. \nShit pay, shit food,  oh yeah and you get shot at.; The pay certainly would be; Good post. Retired Air Force enlisted, I didn't realize how bad Army life was until I was in a meeting with a bunch of Army officers when I was assigned to a joint agency. One it broke their brains AF enlisted were there. Two they kind of lamented how Army enlisted were treated in a weird detached way. \n\nI have more stories because it was a joint base. When I became a contractor I worked with a couple of guys who were Army IT and yeah they barely got to do anything good when they were in. \n\nAir Force Officers are master gaslighters and the politics are absolutely ridiculous. Particularly from non prior enlisted officers.; Hey thanks for replying. I am considering the navy, and I see online they have open positions where I live (if true through job boards). I have a degree, so would look at going in as officer. Would I have the ability to select one of those positions? How does that work? Would I need to take the asvab?; And that's easier, quicker, and less painful then spending an enlistment in the Army like I did. \n\n\nOr look at the national guard or reserves.\n\n\nBut if you wanted to do a stint in the regular military for other reasons, looking at it as an experience in and of itself, that's cool.  That's essentially what I wanted as an early 20s person. \n\n\nHowever not everyone in my unit made it back home, so factor that in too.  It's not a game.  You can be killed.; That is what I am leaning into. Going to talk to a recruiter tomorrow. Have a kid on the way, so a bit nervous, but someone was saying I could (maybe) get stationed where I live. I also see job postings for the location I live at, so not sure if they are really here, or just being used as an advertisement type thing.; Depends, at 50 OP could retire with health benefits. Also OP could be deployed so it's all a crap shoot.; You get stationed where the Navy tells you that you get stationed. That's how the military works, outside of very, very, specific circumstances/jobs. \n\nThose job postings on indeed,LinkedIn, etc are just military recruiters. The location isn't where you'll get stationed, it's where they're operating out of usually. \n\nBased on your job you choose and the needs of the military determines where you get stationed. You may get a preference of a top 5, and could get selected from those choices but it really comes down to the needs of the military at the end of the day. \n\nTypically with officer contracts, unless it's a very specific role like CyberSec for example, you don't pick specific jobs, you pick areas of preference such as Infantry, Artillery, Logistics, Comms, Intelligence, CyberSec, etc. And based on certain metrics throughout your boot camp and your trainings like best scores, best PT score, best marksmanship/training etc, you get placed on a rankings list, and that determines first choice of field. \n\nFor specific fields like being a doctor, nurse, cybersecurity analyst, software stuff,dentist, etc etc you will have the ability to specifically choose that role because your qualifications for it are tested and approved of beforehand in the recruitment process.; Lol... I thought I'd get stationed in my hometown. I didn't. You will go where the military needs you not where you want to go. Go talk to the recruiter. If you have questions after that send me a DM or post in the appropriate sub.; If you want to get stationed somewhere specific, get it in the contract before you sign. Recruiters will promise the world, but don’t believe a damn thing if it’s not in your contract.\n\nSame goes for the specific job you are targeting. Idk how the navy works, but for army OCS, the army assigns you to the job they need you in at the end of the day. I’d hate for you to join the navy for a clearance and become a logistics officer or something."

   "Top Comments": "The ppl who harp on building up your GitHub massively overestimate its impact. The avg employer is not going to look at it unless whatever you did actually, legitimately is something that stands out or is relevant; No. Well my hiring manager in big banking said he looks but it only hurts the candidate. Don’t give him something to criticize. You passed the coding test. Leave it at that.; I think it’s pretty rare for the average employer to care about your github. I’d say giving live short links to your projects on your resume is better, which is why front end dev has a bit of an edge in the “show and tell” arena.; When I interviewed interns and fresh grads I never looked unless they already stood out somehow. Too easy to copy or paste code.; I will take a look. If there is something worthwhile it is a bonus. \n\nIf it’s just forked repos and half baked work it’s a negative.; I have found that the only time employers give a shit about your personal projects, is when they are generating revenue i.e. when you don't actually need a job.; I've never looked at github. It doesn't tell me anything useful I need to know to make a hiring decision.; Wont hurt to have some projects done but i dont think github is being looked at. Portfolio maybe but who guarantee's you didnt do copy pastes there too lol.; I always do but you get negative points for copy pasted paint by numbers projects.\n\nFor any legitimate projects and stuff I'll read through them to get a sense of what the developer is like.; I always look at the Githubs linked on resumes. I only hire entry level developers, so a lot of the projects are homework. But there is a rare event where the candidate will have a cool project they contribute to on a regular basis.\n\nA lot of times if I ask about something on a person's GIT, they act like it's the first time they've heard of it and can't speak to what they did or how they did it.; No, it really doesn't make sense from an employers perspective unless its specifically for contributing to open source.\n\nI mean think about it.  If you are employed and your github is lit then that means you weren't working as much.  It means that if they hire you, you will be working a lot on your github instead of actual work.; For practicality purposes, which recruiter is going to read 900 github codes? On top of that, aren't recruiters as dumb as the chick/guy you randomly pick up as a bar? ffs, those people are the reasons qualified people can't get a job in the 1st place. Now you expect the same people to actually read your actual work after pretending to know what you did from reading your resume? Please.\n\nAnd even so if they are actual engineers, good  ones at that, I would reckon they should assume all github codes are filled with copied/pasted/pirated code. What's the point?\n\nAnd even if the codes are legit, so what, it's not a completed functional working app. Build an app, publish it, and let recruiters play with it. If they like it, they don't care how you conjured it. This is the way to go.; GitHub is definitely neither sufficient nor necessary for a CS career. I have successful peers with no GitHub and struggling peers who have one. \n\nWhen I've been on hiring committees I would look at GitHub but not in a ton of detail. I don't expect anything huge and polished for early career people, but a couple obviously copy/pasted tutorial things don't mean anything to me.\n\nWhen I've looked for jobs, most employers don't seem to look at mine much but I have had a few make comments here and there. I've had two very positive interviews where I was able to reference a GitHub project where I've solved a similar problem to what I was asked.\n\n_Recruiters_ on the other hand do seem to find me from GitHub pretty often, but that might be a bit of a lucky break on my part.\n\nIMO, from both sides of the table, building a GitHub is a nice way to sharpen your skills in a high visibility way, not a checkbox item for qualifying for jobs.; Someone who I interviewed showed his github.  None of us bothered to look at it.; I’m a hiring manager at a startup and I will always look at a candidates GitHub. If one isn’t provided and a candidate otherwise looks great, I will ask for it or some sort of project portfolio. If they don’t have or provide one it’s a red flag for me.\n\nA quick glance into a GitHub profile tells me a lot about how a person works, how they document code, and if they complete the projects they start. \n\nI don’t expect large companies to do much of that, but it’s a really strong signal for startups or small teams.; I feel like this was really good advice in like 2010.  Now as long as you get an interview, you tend to be evaluated solely on your performance during the interview.  Especially with LC etc, they can make a level playing field for everyone.  Resume matters just to get to that stage.; For junior candidates I can imagine the odd hiring manager looks at the shortlist create by HR. But to look at whether you have proper test coverage, and no glaring code readability issues. Everything beyond that would take too much time.; deleted mine idgaf lol; Nope; My manager looked at my github when hiring me.

I was between contract jobs and needed to submit 2 job applications a week to get unemployment benefits.  It wasn’t a senior level job but it set me on the path of my career that is pushing 15 years as a software developer.; If it's a little higher than your experience or you're just missing a few skills, then apply.

I’m not sure what exactly translates to a CS grad but as a SQL+Python+Tableau person myself who has only ever used the AWS Suite I apply for any role that talks about the same core job responsibilities as mine but says I need to know SQL+R+PowerBI on Azure. Like wtf, which self respecting engineer thinks not knowing one versus the other is a deal breaker.; Yes, it's a waste of time because there are plenty of people they can choose from that have more experience than you. I stopped applying to jobs that don't fit my tech stack and experience a long time ago, now I target jobs by a specific number of YoE and tech stack. If you want to be able to filter jobs by a specific number of YoE, tech stack, education, clearance, etc. check out the job board I made: 6j dot gg; being under qualified is as bad as being over qualified believe it or not.; You are right. Don't apply for senior roles. It's a little weird and cringe to see those applications drop in from the other side.\n\n    Am I really missing out on that 0.1% to get these high level jobs?\n\nNo. The people who go out of University and into really nice jobs with high pay and perks have the skills to back it up. \n\nIf you mean a 0.1% chance of bullshitting your way into a position you're totally unqualified for. What do you think you're missing out on? These positions come with a certain level of responsibility that you will need to be able to handle. Not going to be a fun ride bullshitting your way into hell.\n\nBut... yes, do a little bit of bullshitting. But on the appropriate level that you can. If you get an interview for a relatively entry level position that might be just above your reach, go for confidence and a bit of bullshitting. Don't go too far up with the bs is all I'm saying, it's a big fall down.; [removed]; [removed]; [removed]; No. But also apply with referral. It’s a game changer. Trust me.; If your not qualified chances are you’ll fail the technically interview anyway. As for your family tell them ‘I am a new graduate with no experience, that job posting you sent me said senior that means I’m not qualified for it’ or if you want BS you sent your CV but heard nothing back likely because hiring manager/ HR filtered you out due to not meeting the requirements. \n\nGood luck with the job search if you know what stack you want to work with I’d advise some self projects keep expanding your knowledge and apply for roles asking for a max of 2/3 years.; I mean, don't prioritize it but many times those job postings might be for a range of levels, from Jr. to Sr."

I have even more troubles understanding commenters that go as far as putting the blame on OP for complaining, or even mocking him. Most of the commenters seem to actually say the recruitment process is terrible, yet proceed to say \"yeah that's normal, stop complaining\"? That makes no sense to me. I hoped commenters could have simply acknowledged how distressing this is for OP (or was for them!) and shown a bit of kindness.; Then maybe Samsung could state that other people also scored 100% and were selected for <additional reason> instead of saying 100% is not sufficient in a meaningless way :/; its  up to the employer they can reject for whatever reason.; They're not entitled to a job, they're entitled to a meaningful response why they weren't selected for the next step. \"Achieved result is not sufficient\" is not a meaningful response when the achieved result is 100%.; I can almost guarantee that \"saying 100% is not sufficient in a meaningless way\" is just a standard rejection email template\n  \nedit: now that I re-read again, no company is going to disclose what that <additional reason> is to you; OA passing is just the first step. Then the recruiter looks at your resume. And then ranks you against other resumes who had perfect scores (or near perfect scores).\n\nThe ones with brand name internships and brand name colleges take preference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's just what it is. Opportunities go to students from brand name schools first. There's plenty of perfect scorers. Recruiters are going to down the list from the most prestigious schools.\n\nIt's also why many who have perfect scores don't get interviews while someone who has over 80% might (since college brand name and brand name internships is more 'important').\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anything, as supply of aspiring CS graduates go up, the more important the college name is. You want your school to be from places like CMU, Ivy League, MIT, CalTech, UCB EECS, etc. \"100\" can only take you so far. This field isn't merit based after a certain threshold.\n\nIt's one thing if a random state school student gets a 100. It's another thing if a Yale student gets a 100. The latter will almost always get the interview loop over the other if there's limited seats. Also, before someone screams at me how Yale CS is not the best, I would like to note the real world does not care as Yale is one of the feeders to places like Jane Street in this field (the CS undergrads do better than CS undergrads from places like Georgia Tech \\[already a school with great placement\\]).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have learnt that in this industry, the best undergrad degrees for getting a job interview are: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, CalTech, CMU. Not exactly following CS department rankings here (so wtf is this 'CS undergrad' rankings from US News?).\n\nTurns out recruiters are liberal art majors who get awed by brand names (CMU being exception because its CS is so good) and the results are reinforced because interviews are essentially like SATs (standardized tests which many students from those schools are good at). Makes you really wonder why go through UIUC and all when the top 20 privates have similar effects anyway. That said, UIUC, UMich, Georgia Tech, UW also do well overall though I do feel the top privates despite its CS grad rankings seem to have better results.; They're not really entitled to that either; I have legit never had a company tell me why lol. This includes making it several rounds into multiple FANGS… I’ve actually never heard of anyone getting told an exact reason lol; [deleted]; People are entitled to nothing in this world.\n\n\nHowever, people are dumb and violent.\n\n\nTell a person that they aren't entitled to a future and they will take yours. Even if that is the most irrational thing they could possibly do.; Not according to the performance eval. Until they require surveys like dealerships do after every damn visit nobody cares.; > Even if that is the most irrational thing they could possibly do.\n\nIt wouldn't be though, and we're getting to that point very soon.; ;)"

   "Title": "Quick Question about security and HIPAA violations",
   "Top Comments": "I'd try and reach out to an internal audit / compliance team and tip them off to it, discretely if necessary.  It's in the company's best interest that this be detected and remediated before it becomes a beach.\n\n\nI'd look at using tokenization and moving that to another database / table if the rest of the data doesn't require the same level of protection.\n\n\nIt's not HIPAA though.  That's for medical records.  It's just PII.  Your company might be on hook for credit monitoring if there is a breach.; We're not lawyers. If you have a legal question, go talk to a lawyer. Imagine us telling you you're fine and then you end up being personally liable? Or imagine us telling you to GTFO, but you would've actually been fine so you just lost a job over nothing?\n\nIs the database itself encrypted? That's a flip of a switch for an RDS instance. That would likely meet the security requirements of HIPAA. Even encryption isn't a \"requirement\" per se as I understand it, as long as you have security measures protecting unauthorized access from that information.\n\nYou also might be too focused on the SSN itself. Someone's date of birth is PHI. That doesn't have a second layer of encryption on it, does it? Leaking everyone's names and dates of birth would still be a breach. You're drawing an arbitrary line because you consider a SSN sensitive, but PHI is PHI.\n\nAgain, not a lawyer, but my understanding is that even if this were a violation, it's on your company, not on you personally. There are some things you can do that would make you personally liable, but the company making an architectural decision like this isn't on you.\n\nEither way, I would leave these kinds of decisions up to the company's lawyers and HIPAA Compliance Officer. I'm just a software engineer.; So, the risk is that HIPAA violation penalties apply *per instance*. That means if an entire database worth of PHI is leaked, that's a potential multi-million dollar fine. They do have guidelines for data at rest, and there *are* many cases of astronomical fines.\n\nAs for specifically storing SSNs unencrypted, the severity might depend on the exact details. There could be system disk encryption that makes it possible for you as a dev to transparently access a database while maintaining encryption on data at rest. Maybe you only have access to staging data and production access is gated. Maybe the whole thing is a total zoo.\n\nThe ideal setup is to work w/ HIPAA compliance consultant to identify gaps and resolve them, because I imagine audits are going to happen at some points. If you recommend this and the powers that be don't listen, it's out of your hands.; I would expect the security to come from securing access to the database itself, and not from the frontend server reading and decrypting blobs from said database.; It depends. As long as the db itself is encrypted it should be enough. All of the PHI (including their name) needs to be secured, SSN is just another piece.; What do you mean by SSN?; Well, I just did this. They gave the dumbest reply I've ever seen. Here it is:\n\n\"I want to reassure you that the HIPAA Security Rule does NOT require PHI to be encrypted when at rest.  Rather, encryption is an “addressable” standard.  That means we have to do a risk assessment and determine whether and how encryption would be a reasonable and appropriate control in protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of e-PHI.\n\nSo HIPAA does not mandate encrypting data at rest, nor does any other federal or state law that I am aware of. \"\n\nIm guessing this is a sign of either laziness or incompetence?; Telling a manager and keeping an email trail of being told to duck off would be useful if they are concerned about personal liability.  That's the extent of what you can do when you don't make management decisions.; In general those are just the mandatory fines from HHS; if you're a business associate to a covered entity and a breach happens due to your wilful negligence in addition to the covered entity you're providing services to potentially suing you, the people that got their PHI breached can sue you too; Social Security Number, so a type of personally identifiable information (PII) number in the USA.; Well, it does for government and federal contractor systems that fall under FISMA, NIST SP 800-53, or SP 800-171.\n\n\nFor other  public sector systems, they may be correct that you are not required to encrypt.  But under many state breach laws, you don't have to report it if the data that was exfiltrated was encrypted to a certain industry or government standard, like FIPS 120-2/3.\n\n\nThat differs per state though, and it's not my domain, other than me being a security dev and reading about it.; And when a beach happens, if it's significant, you can bet there will be law suits for negligence / beach of fiduciary responsibility."

I had a lot of trouble getting interviews, so I decided to learn ML in early 2018 then got a job in the field in the latter half of 2018. It paid like $120k TC.

Review the code for bugs, code cleanliness, design problems, if it follows best practices, optimizations and so forth. Make suggestions for how to fix them. In general start big and get more narrow i.e. don't spend your time nitpicking when there's a giant flaw. Talk through your thought process and ask questions if you're stuck. IME these interviews are usually pretty chill.; In an interview setting, they'd probably be looking for insights on maintainability (e.g. beest practices, idiomatic style, etc) more so than syntax nitpicks; Run a formatter and linter to avoid dumb mistakes like messy syntax.; Thank you for your advice! That's more or less what I was thinking of doing so I am glad I am in the right track!\n\nAny common pitfalls that comes to mind?\n\nOr anything that has made you think a candidate stands out?; Giving that I have no experience, what should I say about best practice? Isn't that mostly language / company based?; Well, the code has been sent through a repo already and has been \"approved\", what ever that might mean. I think its a bit too late clean up the code, unfortunately.\n\n\nAny other advice you might be willing to share?; Lack of communication is a common pitfall in virtually any technical interview. Candidates get so focused on the solution they forget to communicate. Remember that solving a problem is only one data point we (interviewers) look at. You'll often hear from seasoned interviewers that they've hired the candidate who got the problem wrong yet communicated effectively over the \"10x dev\" who said nothing for 45 min. Practice thinking out loud if you're not good at it.\n\nJustify your suggestions. A bug fix is black and white, but there will almost certainly be grey in the code. If you have an opinion for why something should be changed you should have a justification for it. \"I would do that this way\" is not a good reason if \"because\" doesn't follow. \n\nAnd it should go without saying, but be cautious of how you frame your comments. While it is just an exercise it says a lot about your collaboration skills if you come across condescending or rude. Use a neutral tone. Positive where you can. In fact, code review doesn't always have to be looking for changes. It can be appropriate to give the author props for how they implemented something.

Was it the background company that flagged it and they ghosted? That seems very strange; Couple thousand applications and only a few interviews? That seems like trouble. Specifically resume trouble. You would hope to get 1 interview per 100 applications on average. So a couple thousand resumes should generate at least 25 interviews. Ask some tech people to review your resume. Or post it here with private info redacted.; Hi. After looking at your post, I have similar issues. My CS program ended on 5/2022. But I reported I got my degree on 06/2022 because graduation happened on 06/2022. one of the interviewers said I was lying if I put my degree date on 06/2022.\nAnother problem is  paid internship, I know hr or founder here has said it is fine to take it possiblly due to free work for them. But when it runs in the background check,isn't it going to be problem?; time to get that forklift certification; It is only 4+ months.  As long as you are getting interviews, luck is around the corner; I'm the same level of experience. I went full balls-to-the-wall on my non-tech small business on the side while still employed, just in case tech ends up being a wash. I find it more fun than tech, actually - and I get to use tech with programming all the inventory / accounting / vendor interop systems. I'm also exploring alternative careers that I can continue doing until my small biz becomes sustainable to the level of a tech income.; > I took a couple months just to clear my head and think about what I want to do next. I've done this a few times in the past where I'd quit a job I'd burned out on and live on savings for a few months until I got another one.  \n\nThis is very understandible, but this isn't the job market to do this in. Are you in a place with local employers? Are you willing/able to move to one? Are you able to get a clearance? If you're focusing on the fully remote tech company stuff that everyone else it going for, the odds are against you.; If you can’t find a job then a fresh grad like me is fucked.; Do you have any deep domain experience? I’ve found the easiest route for me is applying to companies that are in domains that I have expertise in ( think defense, education, manufacturing, etc ); No one knows. This could be the end of software engineers in the developed countries. Like the manufacturing jobs. Gone forever. Or it could bounce back. I would pivot to AI if you still can.; I think big techs are artificially making things hard so that at the end of the market crisis they can hire for cheaper and of course on-site. They didn't really like so many people not coming back to the office (the ones that had an on-site contract).\nSo you might wait it out, but at the same time there is this rampant ageism (but actually lower salary preference), so they might still refill their ranks with younger or less experienced guys when the crisis is over.; Have you tried networking, having 12yrs of experience i  would assume you would have connections ( friends / former colleague ) why don't to try getting referral from them  and then apply ?; If you're getting to the whiteboards and failing, that should tell you that the problem is lacking whiteboarding and interviewing skills. It's a tough market so we actually have to try. \n\n I wouldn't even bother applying anymore until you get those nailed down tight. That means LC Medium at a minimum and a couple of practice interviews. Once you get that down, it's standard practice to ask the interviewer what kind of whiteboarding questions they will ask so you can prepare. You can't afford to be surprised by anything that happens in the interview.; Dude, you are in a much better position than new graduates, boot camp graduates, or people got laid off with less than three 3YOE.; My interview rate is like 3-8% every week with about 100 apps sent out every week, and I work in the same space as you with less experience (8ish years).  I don’t mess with my resume at all, and I shill my nice portfolio site to every recruiter I can.  OP post your resume and tell us where you live and the market you’re gunning for here.  If you say “I need a Visa,” the issue is R&D tax write offs getting axed, not the market.  A visa is significantly more expensive now for a company.; I think if you are sending out 1000s of resumes without a response you need to either reconstruct your resume with the help of reddit, or you need to rethink the jobs you are applying to. I say this because I was in a similar position of not getting replies as a new grad. I had 0 software engineering internships when I started my search for a full time role, so I thought it was just normal. \n\nHowever after reconstructing my resume in the GA tech resume template and essentially copying resumes of people who didnt have work experience who have gotten interviews before and substituting my projects in place of theirs, I suddenly started getting responses for almost every new grad position I applied to that listed the tech my projects included in their job description and I would at least get a phone interview. I failed many interviews that were technical because outside of coursework I never touched DSA style problems.\n\nUltimately I landed a position, and now that I'm looking to move on to grow professionally after 2 years I'm finding that the same still applies. I have targeted roles that I'm interested in that I don't have experience in, and it's rare that I get a response. On the other hand, in a role that uses almost the same stack I use my response rate is closer to 50/50 in terms of cold applying and I usually get to the tech/behavioral interview phase. My issue is I'm actually finding it difficult to find a role with a pay raise. Almost every position I apply to that requires 2-3 years of experience pays the same or less with worse benefits.; So I just spent 8 months on the job market after getting laid off from FAANG company, I have 2 YOE and come from a top school but I wasn't getting responses to my resumes and I was failing the few technical interviews I was getting. I took a step back and signed up for an interview prep bootcamp, paid 4K and invested 2 months. Now I have three offers. The algorithms and data structures training helped but it was the career training, counseling, and mock interviews that made the biggest difference.; Consider switch to nursing , maybe some degree of physical demanding but job guaranteed"

It's supposed to be hybrid but nobody ever goes in lol. I'm now doing .NET/Angular so I guess that's okay. It's definitely not where I want(ed) to be, and the pay decrease sucks, but I figured I was tired of the NEETdom and my bank account numbers going down. Also, the job I got laid off from was something I scored during the Great Resignation, so that explains the salary boost and the eventual layoff.\n\nP.S.

IMO, it seems like they’d want to fight for higher pay for you but in the end it’s all a numbers game for them, they just want to work in volume. So my experience has been they just try and push me through to stuff\n\nSee my other reply though, it’s important to tailor your cover letter to the role in question, and you should always do research on the companies first. Know what they do, where they are in funding, who their customers are, etc; Thanks! I went through LinkedIn job listings, which did result in some ghosts but for the most part I was always graced with either a rejection or an invite to an intro call. \n\nSome things to help - I always ALWAYS provided a tailored cover letter and maybe even emphasized certain things in my resume if they fit the job well. Def don’t lie, but you can make yourself stand out for the role in question. For the interviews themselves, having a good, repeatable 2-3 minute intro about yourself is a good thing and will be useful in almost every round. \n\nLastly, you can most likely find some system design questions with answers on Google. It’s good to be able to deep dive on certain aspects — which db you using and why? CAP theorem is important for these problems and it’s also important to be able to articulate the trade off of using certain tools over others. And I’ve noticed a pattern that companies usually want to see where you might utilize message queues/kafka to make things more scalable, retry-able, etc - not one size fits all, but there’s usually some places where you can make things async.\n\nAnd for coding rounds, it sucks paying for a product but a few months of leetcode premium really helped me out.

Poor management decisions, trying economic times, corporate buyouts and private equity acquisitions cause the layoff of swaths of employees or even a once successful business to completely shut down. \n\nOf course, some people do land in companies where they can work long term. For example, a friend of mine who is an embedded software engineer (now manager) has worked at the same company for 35 years. But, it's more of an exception.; No, I'm not having THAT kind of anxiety, but thank you for your concern bot.; As an example, my current contact ends in January unless it's renewed, but I'm not losing sleep over it. I'm using it as an excuse to push myself to grow and be ready for bigger things if I get that push to look for new opportunities.  Not that I'm eager to jump just yet as stability for stretches of time is nice too, because work isn't everything.; Agree with this 100%; Thanks for the advice man. Yeah, my soon-to-be-past company had the tell-tale signs. Haphazard management, low pay, the employers nitpicking the way I work rather than looking at the actual output of my work, conformity over meritocracy, etc. I am never going to fit in here long term."

   "Top Comments": "2 weeks to a month.\n\nThere are multiple prunings etc every so often.; Try to filter out 24 hours, 1 week and so forth as many as you can apply.; If it’s on a website like LinkedIn, then up to a month. If the job is posted on the company’s website directly then you should apply even if it’s been posted a year ago. I have a website that uses AI-filters and collects jobs posted directly by companies (6j dot gg) and have gotten interviews after applying to jobs posted more than a year ago. That’s because some companies use the same job posting over the years without changing anything in it.; 7 days is about my limit. ; Fairs. I targeting 20-30 apps per day. It's super tough finding that many listings im fit for in a past 72 hour filter so I'll expand then.; Oh nice, thank you for the tip I'll use that."

   "Title": "Starting to regret my career as a developer",
   "Top Comments": "Can't really offer much help apart from sharing my own story and perspective.\n\nI was a complete retard at 20, wasted my early 20s by fucking around in minimum wage dumps that drained my sanity far worse than any developer job ever can. I would have killed to be in your position again, from just an outsider's perspective, think about a headstart you got in terms of finances and future industry experience, that's like winning the lottery.\n\nDon't get too fixated on home ownership, it's way too overhyped and people often needlessly panic. I'd argue in your twenties it's more of a burden than an advantage, you won't be able to easily move for jobs, less insentives to move countries or cities (if you want that). Even financially renting cheap apartments + investing in ETFs historically is about the same as buying a house but with the added freedom to do whatever you want in life without tethering yourself to a location.\n\nAlso, a lot of what you describe is just being young, at that age no one gets their shit together and they have no idea what to do with their lives, as sad as it sounds seems like when you're young regretting stuff and being unsure of the future is completely normal.\n\nAnd do not get blinded by the \"grass is greener on the otherside\" stuff you hear from your friends or on the internet. Dev jobs are by far the best in terms of options and opportunities. You can either grind or coast while being paid a lot of money.\n\nFinding meaning in what i do is something i struggle with as well, so I purposefully chosen jobs where at least i contribute to something tangible. Don't fall for crypto/ai scam/hype bullshit, don't work for outsourcing companies/webshop agencies. Just simply working for a small/medium size company no matter the industry i feel like I'm contributing to the overall success(or failure :harodl:) of the company and it's much better than indeed mindlessly creating CRUDs for 17th identical webshop.\n\nTo that last point, grind a little bit and always be curious, dig into the infra side, testing, frontend, backend, understand the business needs etc. It's IMO always better to get a broad knowledge of the field. It empowers you to make better decisions in your own work, teamwork also becomes much easier when people actually understand each other and don't toss work over the fence to each other blindly.\n\nTL;DR you've won the lottery in life, make the most out of it and enjoy life doing what you want.; Hey, since you’re young with minimal expenses, now's a great time to explore new paths. Maybe look for tech roles related to your interests in biking or cars? Networking in those hobbies could open up cool opportunities. Consider a hybrid work model to fix the social interaction issue. For Australia, how about a shorter trip to avoid using all your savings? It’s a solid time to experiment before bigger life commitments kick in.; I would err on the side of a less meaningful job that pays well vs a passion job that has crap pay.\n\nVery few people are going to make an impact on the world via their job... and that's ok!\n\nHaving money opens up many doors for you to find meaning in your free time as well as just makes life a lot smoother in general.  Especially if your hobbies are mountain biking and cars... which can get expensive.\n\nWhat you should do, is figure out how to find the challenges/social interaction you are looking for outside of work.  Work to live, don't live to work.; I had 4 other careers before I became a SWE. Every single one of these careers was about making someone else richer.; I think a lot of people have been 'reddit shamed' (for lack of a better term) for wanting social output from work.\n\nFor lots of people a place of work is somewhere to meet people, and build friendships and a network. \n\nThere is no shame for moving jobs to somewhere where that is more possible. As a 20 year old there will be tons of software houses with people in your age range. \n\nI'd give it a try before leaving the industry to altogether; To me, it feels like most of your complaints have nothing to do with your job. In fact, if viewed in a different way, your job is what is allowing you the financial and mental freedom to think about what you want to accomplish outside of it.\n\nEven paramedics and scuba instructors have a ton of their jobs that are business/metrics related. I've had a EMT friend who left the field for tech support because their corporate managers would fuss over how wasteful they were when they were busy saving someone from dying on the way to the hospital. The way he figured was, \"If everything has to be spreadsheets, I'd rather be questioned for something I don't give a shit about than being made to feel bad for holding on to a life.\"\n\nThis is free advice so it's worth what you paid for it: It sounds like you need to find a new job where you feel the product you're contributing code to is trying to do something more tangible than whatever product your company sells. As for extracurriculars, there's no other way than going out of your way to find people with your interests. You're not going to find groups of mountain biking/car afficionados in any one career path v/s another. One of the most outdoorsy people I know is a product manager for Google banging out powerpoint upon powerpoint showcasing who-really-cares-about-this-shit metrics for 50 hours a week before going dirtbiking for the weekend.; I'll just say, don't confuse a \"job\" for a \"career\".\n\nWhat you seem to be describing is not liking your current \"job\". It's normal to have to jump around a fair amount to find a place you enjoy. You'll find that most companies are either poorly run or are just a poor fit for you personally. But you currently have a sample size of 1. That's just not a meaningful amount of data to make any judgements on. \n\nIn my career I've disliked 2/3 of the companies I've worked at. But I've spent 2/3 of my career at places I loved. I just had to keep looking and moving on.\n\nThis is likely to be the case in ANY field you work in. You can't base all your career choices off the assumption that you will love the very first place you work.; I also relate to that feeling of being rather inconsequential at the moment. Which I think is also just exasperated by me not really having any interest in the product I currently work on and also some mismanagement in the past year or so. It's a tough feeling to navigate, even when everything else seems to be going well on paper.; I also have 2 years of experience (or technically...3). And wow, I thought Malaysia is fucking horrible. UK also pays software engineers almost like they are paying petty clerks huh. Just barely above median wage, just like here.....; I don't have a degree either and build crud apps that don't do anything but increase shareholder value too. What motivates me at work is making a lot of money, flexible work hours, WFH, and helping other people climb the corporate ladder so that they can enjoy these kinds of benefits too.\n\nI don't need a meaningful job as long as it's an enjoyable way to spend my time and it supports my lifestyle; I get the lack of social interaction when working from home, I really didn't like it at first because so much of my routine and lifestyle assumed I'd be spending 40 hours a week in a room full of people, and the adjustment was tricky. That being said, now that I did adjust, I wouldn't give it up for anything. WFH allowed me the freedom to move across the country to start a relationship that became my marriage, and when I developed chronic health problems, it became the difference between being employed and not. I found other ways to make friends and have a pretty fulfilling social life outside of work, but there are days where I don't feel up to socializing or driving somewhere and it's nice that I can take care of myself without risking my job. All that is to say, it's an adjustment, but I'd really recommend making friends outside of work and finding a roommate or two your own age instead of living with your parents whether you move to hybrid or not, because you'll have periods of time between jobs in your career and it'd be nice if you still had a social life in those times.\n\nAs for the work being meaningless outside of increasing shareholder value... what did you expect? This really won't change no matter what job you take in this industry, maybe in government/public sector it won't be shareholders but the work will still feel so far removed from real-world impact that it'll kind of suck. You really have to enjoy the work itself, or this career will make you miserable.\n\nFinally, just a bit of advice - don't buy a house in your 20s. Just don't do it, it is not worth it. You don't know where you're going to end up wanting to live, whether you'll want to stay in this career long-term, how much house you even want, etc. You could end up in a situation where you're stuck in a career you hate because your mortgage payments are too high, moving to a cheaper rental is much easier than selling a home. When I bought my home, the inspector estimated $20k in total repair costs - it turned out to be $70k, waiting on the repairs would have been dangerous, and the home has not appreciated as much as historical trends would have indicated. So far in two years, I have spent $200000 between mortgage payments, property taxes and repairs, and this is a relatively average 30 year old home.; I've got a couple of years in this industry, and being in my mid-30s I've dabbled in quite a few different career paths. Something it's taken me quite a while to realize is that while engagement and purpose would be nice, my job allows me to live a fulfilling life outside of my job. That's it. A job is a means to make money so that you can have a (hopefully) great life outside of said job. I have very few professional acquaintances that I've made over the years at jobs, and none that I would really call \"friends\". Any friends that I've made has been either through school or through mutual hobbies. Try joining a club or taking a class on the weekends or in your free time. Heck, if your town has tech meetups, also try going to those. Just don't expect much from your work aside from money and professionality.; Imo the answer for you is to simply find the right role/company/team. I worked in a more diverse role several years ago and I would travel to new sites when we were deploying new systems. Our customer had a large physical machine, and our company handled all the IT and data stuff. So after developing at home for several months, I would typically have ~1 month of travel to go to site and wear a hardhat and steel toe boots as I ran through testing and validation with the customer. Then helped to troubleshoot any issues live. It was a really cool experience and I think you would enjoy a role with a similar mix instead of writing crud apps from home 365 days a year. Tech is used literally everywhere, there are challenging and cool jobs out there\n\nAnother idea that comes to mind is product management. Those guys are less technical, but very social in my experience. Seems to be more of a creative job which could be something you lack as well. \n\nHonestly young dev jobs are just kinda shitty a lot of the time lol; You mentioned you ride mtb. Have you considered join a local riders group? I dont ride much anymore but in my limited experience there are a lot of great people in their 20s. ; [removed]; [removed]; You’re planning on having kids and making a mortgage?; [removed]; Hey, since you’re young with minimal expenses, now's a great time to explore new paths. Maybe look for tech roles related to your interests in biking or cars? Networking in those hobbies could open up cool opportunities. Consider a hybrid work model to fix the social interaction issue. For Australia, how about a shorter trip to avoid using all your savings? It’s a solid time to experiment before bigger life commitments kick in.; You honestly just need more friends and hobbies. \n\nWork is not supposed to be your identity.\n\nA bike shop? That’s a dead end job that will set you back IMO."

   "Title": "Applicants turn camera off",
   "Top Comments": "1. I think you should make it explicit that its a video interview, some people may assume its a quick call.\n\n2. If its clear that its a video interview, candidates that refuse to turn on their camera should cease to be candidates. They may have valid reasons, but they could also be trying to do some identity fraud and thats not a risk you should entertain.; After being burnt once by this all technical interviews are either in person or with the camera on and the screen being shared. \n\nI don't care what you look like, I do care about verifying that the person I'm speaking to is the applicant for the job.; I'm not interviewing people remotely without them having their camera on. I'd ask them to turn it on and if they'd refuse, it would be a very short interview.\n\nCheck with your manager what their view is on this.; I had an awkward situation a few years back when I was interviewing and the interviewer did not have his camera on while I did. Never said the reason why or attempted to turn it on. I stared at his name on Zoom for 30 min while talking to him. He also told me he was short on time and had something scheduled right after (not work related), and made it sound like the interview was poorly scheduled (honestly probably was, but that's not my fault). He would have been one of my team leads. No thanks, didn't follow up.; Culture fit fail. Easiest no-hire decision ever.; Make sure you write in the job posting / follow up email:\n\"Please make sure you have everything ready for the video call as we require having the camera on during the interview\"\n\nIf they refuse to turn on the camera without a valid reason, end the interview right away and inform them you won't be moving forward with their application.; If it's an interview, you do what the interviewer is doing.  If they have their camera off, and ask you to turn yours on, that might be a red flag.; You sure they weren't just wildly cheating? \n\nThey have so many tricks. \n\nSmart guy takes interview first gets all the answers and provides notes to the real applicants. \n\nRemote interview has someone else in the room googling and providing help on another monitor. \n\nSometimes, the person just moves their mouth and pretends there is a bad connection as someone else in the room speaks for them. \n\nThey have a 2nd screen to cheat off, so we get software to detect that, but then they just get a 2nd laptop to cheat off of. \n\nThe only way to cut down on cheating via remote was to have the candidate stand up with their laptop camera.on and spin around showing the whole room. And that only cut down the cheating it didn't stop it.\n\nWith no camera on, cheating would be trivial.; For me it goes both ways, if the interviewer has it on, I'll turn my on, but don't expect me to turn mine on if you don't. I need a face to associate with the company.\n\nSame goes the otherway around. If the interviewer has it on and the candidate doesn't, its gonna be a very quick interview.; I just finished two rounds of interview with around 10 candidates for a mid-level devops role. Among those 10, 3 people were lip syncing, 1 had someone else answering question for them, and 2 using chatGPT to answer questions.\n\nYou cannot take any chances during those interviews my man.; As an interviewer, we require the camera to be on.  As an interviewee, I would expect to have my camera on, I'd expect the interviewer's camera to be on.; It is rude of them because you have your camera on. If I’m in an interview and the other person has their camera on I would put mine on. \n\nBUT it is also a bit on you for not writing it down as a Video Interview. I’ve genuinely had ‘interviews’ over Teams where the interviewers did not put on their cameras and it’s because it wasn’t a final round. \n\nSo some people might have been expecting just an audio call.; \tthey don’t want video interviews because it’s a bait and switch. The person doing the technical interview will be very sound. The real candidate will be borderline special needs. I fell for this many years ago.; I've had this a few times and we changed our instructions that we require a camera and an IDE ready otherwise we won't proceed with the interview. We also state if they can't meet these requirements then we ask the candidate to specify if they can't. \n\nOverall some people aren't comfortable with it which is fine I just like knowing in advance.; A lot of times this is done to cheat the interview. I'm a \"never turn camera on at work\" type of person but I still had it on during interviews.; Question is, were they told prior to the interview that cameras were a must? Communication is taken for granted at times.; I don't feel this post deserves downvotes, it's very much a valid topic.\n\nWhen I first began in the company I worked for, I was pretty shy with the camera. In some presentations with a lot of people, the director would kindly ask to see some cameras on out of respect for the speaker, and that did the trick.\n\nI'd just ask. Ask in a way that makes it sound like it is normal to have the camera on.\n\nIn 1:1 calls with engineers, especially ones I've never met in person, I always start with a video call. I notice quite a number of them start with their cameras off, but quickly turn them on if I've got mine on. It should feel like a human response to do so.\n\nI'll never forget this internal interview I had with a two panel. One hiring manager for the team had his camera on, and the other one had his hidden *and* he removed his ID picture from his avatar. This dude has worked for the company for over two decades. Very talented but I soon got a sense his social skills and empathy really matched his anti-social gesture. As the person being interviewed, it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth about this guy. And of course he was the one to ask unreasonable \"questions\".\n\nI promised myself, if I ever had another panel interview with him on it, I'd just flat-out refuse to move forward or answer *his* questions if dude couldn't be assed to set his insecurities aside for an hour or two. Like grow the fuck up 😂; Lmao wtf. Can’t even be bothered to turn the camera on?? Well, I can’t be bothered to hire you then; We let someone keep their camera off during an interview and they ended up being a different person which lead to massive security issues since we’re in government contracting. Now we require cameras to be on.; When I interviewed for my current job it specifically said \"video optional\" and I thought that must be a way to weed people out.\n\nThen the interview started. And it's a panel with 3 interviewers. And none of them have their videos on. Mine is on though, because I dressed nice, got a haircut -- I want them to see that I am taking it seriously. The main interviewer goes, \"Well video is optional but okay I guess I'll turn mine on too then.\"\n\nTurns out, nobody at this organization turns their camera on, pretty much ever.. the rare exception is if they're leading a seminar or something. It's pretty great ngl"

In one of these projects, I delivered a critical architectural feature which resulted in me becoming a maintainer of the project.\n\nI think these should be mentioned in the resume given the size and nature of the change. So my questions are:\n\n1. Should I place this under work experience? (Given that these were associated with me being an engineer at my company) Or should this be placed along with projects? Or a separate section to mention open source contributions?\n2. How much should I elaborate on the contributions? In my biggest contribution, the one that lead me to become the maintainer, I proposed an elaborate design and algorithm of the feature in a GitHub issue to project maintainers and admins, so should I just mention what it achieved in a line or two and point to my PR link and the link explaining the feature?\n\nThanks in advance!; I've been working for a good long time at the same company, got my CS degree while working.

I would do another project and get rid of a lot of the fluff. I just glanced quickly (because that's what the recruiter will do too) and that was my impression. Happy to dig deeper and help if you want :); Thanks for the response! That makes sense; would the first bullet point for each project be redundant since the technologies used are listed next to the project name? Or is it good to have it as a short description of the project? The issue I see with removing the first bullet point would be that it may not be clear what platform the project was made for.\n\nAny other advice is also appreciated!"

   "Top Comments": "You better hold on to that job, with your life. It's a bloodbath out there.; Large tech layoffs all over the industry have put tens of thousands of 'experienced devs' on the market.  Entry level jobs at this point are expecting to fill their 'superman posting' qualifications instead of having to settle for actual entry level people.\n\nThe hungry now-unemployed devs are taking huge paycuts because they want to make sure they have a job in the uncertain market.\n\nOf the jobs you are applying to, good chance less than 1/5 of them are actual postings.  There are so many 'ghost postings' right now that people are only getting jobs via connections.\n\nThis is what happens when you don't have a union though.; Yet, when people make a post talking about how they can’t get a job now, they get criticized on how under qualified their resume must be,  not building projects, not working hard enough…. I am like sure, how about you use the resume that got you into the field and start applying to jobs now to see if it gets you anywhere.\n\nThese people are like those baby boomers who talks about how they fed a family and bought a house with one job and thinking that our generations are just not working hard enough.\n\nUpdate: well, there are already tons of replies questioning about the quality of the OP’s resume. How about stop judging other people and let’s all take a look at your first resume that got you into the door before you assume OP is not qualified? Yall talk like you are flawless while in reality you might just be the lucky one.; I tried the same. It’s a 20% paycut to leave. Most jobs are lowballed way to hell for contractor at $65/hour. You can’t afford to leave either.; There are so many variables at play here that make your market “test” pretty meaningless. \n\n- We have no idea what your resume looks like\n- No idea what jobs you're applying to\n- No idea if you’re qualified (or over-qualified)\n- What area of the world/country you’re in\n- Countless others\n\nYou’ll find plenty of doomers to agree with you here but your anecdotal unscientific experiment tells us nothing about the economy or state of the industry.; Yes, the market is beyond oversaturated. Getting a job now, even with years of production experience + a CS degree is basically a defacto lottery at this point.; It seems like either no one is hiring or any open will be flooded with applicants within few hours. This was a totally different market than the last time I was hopping for jobs (early 2022).; if you have 6 yoe it would make sense that entry level roles would deny you in any economy. clearly overqualied.; 95% of the IT people in my corporation are Indian in a mix of local and offshore.; >my only worry is the big salaries are only going to diminish as people get more and more desperate taking less money just to have anything.\n\nI think that's the point.

My understanding is that you will be at a disadvantage for software roles simply because your degree is not in computer science. This doesn’t mean you can’t get interviews, but you’ll need to make up for it in other ways. You need to prepare a resume that will highlight your skills and accomplishments that are relevant to software development. For you, it might necessitate doing a lot of self-learning and working on a project that enables you to showcase your skills. Once your resume is polished and ready to go, maybe you will land an interview. When that happens, you’ll want to be prepared for Leetcode style evaluation or other depending on the company.

I've been applying to 2-3 jobs a night for about 2ish months now. Tailoring my resume to each job and also applying for jobs below my level. I've had 2 interviews. 1 of which was a referral to a position that only requires 3 yoe, that one is the only one that I'm still in the pipeline for at the moment.  Prior to this year I've never had a problem getting interviews and I've been recruited and hired multiple times without even applying. It's seriously depressing that I can barely get an interview now. ; I would take these stats with a grain of salt, LinkedIn counts any click as an \"applicant\". And I know I always click jobs that I don't end up applying to for various reasons (i.e. viewing if the direct website lists more details like salary on the listing).; Idk, color me skeptical, it's very hard to assess these data without seeing them through time.\n\nWhat does this even show? I don't know, because I'm not looking at the data. Is \"open to work\" and \"linked in jobs\" even something representative of the market? I've never applied to a job on linked in, it's an absolute mess of bad/fake profiles inundating jobs.\n\nFor sure, the market is more competitive right now, due to Section 174 and the end of ZIPR, but folks are still getting jobs, and still getting raises.; 2 to 3 applicants per job posting is not that bad.

I can tell you that when my company was hiring 1 year ago vs 2 years ago it was drastically different experience. 2 years ago we got maybe 2 or 3 people to apply on their own over a span of weeks, we had to pay recruiters to find us some people. A year ago, we opened a position and had 50 people apply in 3 hours. We only left the posting up for 2 days and had over 200 applicants. \n\n\nNot sure if it's the same, worse, or better now than it was 1 year ago but it's certainly much much harder than 2 years ago. ; Was just doing hiring for a software engineer role, we had well over 400 applicants, tons of mid to senior engineers, we only interviewed 20, moved 6 to round 2, and then hired 1. Probably the top 50 - 100 were easily qualified.  Can only offer 1 job at the end of the day but we want to give as many people a shot as possible.; I used to work in accounting which is famously easy for job searchers (I think my graduating class of like 100 students had a 98% job placement rate by the end of the year) and even in that industry, on average, for 1 position we would usually interview at least 3-5 candidates which I assume meant we had on the order of 10s of applicants that got weeded out.; I've had a number of ex co-workers get laid off the last year (most of them 4+ yoe) and it seems like most of them took roughly 3 months to find a job when they were applying way more than I am now, so I'm hopeful that something will come up before my company goes under. ; [removed]; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum account age requirement of **seven** days to post a comment.

Think GitHub actions or something like that. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, just something that allows you to automatically trigger some kind of process any time someone commits something.

You’re partially safe with good job evaluations - written records objective layoffs can be made with - but not completely.\n\nWhat did the the most people in was forced relocation.\n\nDon’t be constantly nervous but I’d have a backup plan in this day and age. Also, I never heard of a layoff between October and January. Looks bad to terminate people around Thanksgiving and Christmas.; OP, please listen to these responses. Your manager cannot prevent you from being laid off because this was an executive-level decision. Your manager literally cannot fight an executive on any decision and definitely cannot file an appeal for this. They are powerless against business decisions.\n\nAt best, your manager _may_ be able to help you transition to a different role within the company.

Around 100 people so no big chance of layoffs but a lot of  people leaving was a bit of a concern for me. Apparently there were many recent hires, lot of things changing left some people dissatisfied so they left. Also lot of non tech roles were not as needed anymore so people let go.\n\nThough apart from layoffs the real chance is the company crashes and burns lol. But my team is awesome and and really helpful which is why I’m really trying to be optimistic. Will still start prep though.; I should hopefully not have to worry about layoffs in the true sense since the company is small and I’m in an extremely important team since there is only one for a critical task. The main people let go were higher ups but it was due to them not producing results. The rest just left for various reasons related to their own teams.

They are flying out final candidates, and not everybody will get the job (most likely). ; If they were already 100% sure about you they wouldn’t fly you out, just make an offer.  They are still deciding.; means you passed the initial screening, but not much more. first time I applied to Google they flew me to the west coast from Europe, and got rejected.

You have to understand that flying a candidate in to the tune of $1000 is pennies to a company. \"back in the day\" tm people would interview at specific companies to try to get essentially a comped or partially comped free trip to New York, etc.; It means you’re good for the next round of interviews. I’ve been flown out several times and not gotten the job.; No. It means you have an interview. They're probably flying out a few candidates.; No. Early in my career, I was flown out to the Northeast for a Director role with a tech consulting firm; I didn’t get the job. Another time Adobe flew me out for an analytics role which I got, but declined down due to a salary mismatch.; I have landed zero of the jobs I've flown out for, but I'm sure you will be fine. ; A lot of people here are automatically saying \"no,\" but I personally think it depends on the company.\n\nIf we are talking about FAANG, then flying out candidates is par for the course. So being flown out in that case doesn't mean much (IMO).\n\nYou'll have to research this company in specific to find out though. Search through Blind and even this sub to see if you get any hits.

There are obviously different types of clearance, but my government contractor had a strict policy that Top Secret Clearance (for example) _had_ to be done in person. They did not want people working on top secret projects in an uncontrolled environment. In fact, top secret work had to be done in a locked room with cameras and you couldn't even bring your phone in. You also had to ring a bell (more like pressing a doorbell button) and announce yourself, letting people know you were coming in.\n\nYou could say, \"well, I just won't do top secret projects then!\" But that is not something you can actually choose most of the time. See, anytime a contractor has a government contract, they have that contract because they won it in a bid. So really, you _don't_ have an idea of what contracts could be coming your company's way. The company bids and takes what they get. Then your manager gives _you_ what they get. And well, if the work is almost entirely top secret, guess what you are going to be asked to do? Top secret work. And will they let you do it at home? Probably not.\n\nSo I would say job security for remote work is not great when you are talking about contract work with the government because it can be unpredictable.; > Started in 2023\n\nYou'll likely need a degree, or be able to substitute for one with equivalent work xp.; Since you are just starting I would suggest you avoid remote work for a while. There’s a lot you will learn informally that comes from contact and just won’t happen when you’re remote. It’s harder to really become meshed with a team working remote, there’s just a lot of nonverbal communication that happens, that needs to happen face to face."

You aren't alone in that.; I have an offer and an upcoming interview lined up. Both with big companies. I had applied to both several times before and all rejections (same as you, 4YOE). I only got these because a recruiter for both contacted me on LinkedIn. So that's my advice - work on your linkedin profile. Add certs, detailed work experience, skills, update resume and profile pic. Then just wait. It's honestly pointless to apply manually anywhere; Tske a deep breath and stay motivated , try to improve ur skills one step at a time...stay strong; It’s a numbers game. I’ve probably applied to well over 1000 jobs since last yr and only got maybe 10-15 interviews. In total I got 3 offers. It just takes a while and some luck.; It helps to filter out rejection emails so you don't get notifications. None of those emails are actually useful unless you are a few interviews deep.\n\n\nApply to a lot of roles and getting rejected by most was always a thing. Today it's just amplified with the market being harder and what I would assume is more automated tools. In the past it was a little easier to finally get an offer and most places wouldn't bother sending you anything if they hadn't even interviewed.; How many applications did it say it already had before you applied? Gotta beat the herd to win the game; The market does seem really shitty right now. \nI briefly applied for a bunch of jobs in 2022 and got a decent amount of responses. \nThis year with the same resume and a little more experience, I either get automated rejections or no responses at all. \nSome of the automated rejections even include that they were looking to hire internally but were required to post a job for an ‘X’ amount of days. \nSo it feels like there are a lot of ghost job postings too. \nIt sucks real bad imo; Try being a student who just finished their BS in CS….

Employers won’t care.; No; No, they still matter for you now but not after you start your first job after graduation.\n\nException: Chick-Fil-A requires all applicants to have their university mail a full transcript *at applicant’s expense* before they will make a job offer. For any years of experience. I mean when applying as an employee. Contractors don’t do that or get judged on their community service.\n\nRest of world just verifies your degree and dates of attendance in the background check.; No. And most places dont care about your grade for the first job; Depends on the company; Real projects experience > grades; Most employers haven't asked me. Some have. \n\nSo in general n probably not, but it depends on the company; Only a teensy handful of employers care. Those employers run the gamut of being middle of nowhere places that have no business knowing, all the way to trading firms like Jane Street. Either way, the industry cares what you've worked on and in what capacity. So in almost all cases, your grades themselves stop being important after you've built up some experience."

It sucks to hear that, but it's life.\n\nHowever, if companies decide to accept lower quality work for less labor costs, then it's on us the consumers to push back with our wallets.; I'm hoping that with enough offshoring, salaries in India will explode, and India will become too expensive for companies.

And then hopefully those companies collapsed soon after.; I have a PhD in ML and have been working on improving LLMs for almost a year now, trying to make them commercially viable. The only « AI » software that came out of a couple million dollar investment in my team is a mediocre customer support chat bot that maybe replaces Indian employees in punjab’s call centers. We still haven’t been able to deploy it reliably anywhere since the Canadian government (rightly) decided that a company deploying chat bots will be liable for everything the chat bot says to customers. Google « air Canada chat bot » for more details lol.; Been beat to death.\n\nAnswer is: AI did not replace engineers 1:1 per se, but, it makes engineers more efficient, therefore, company does not need as many engineers as before to achieve the same productivity. this effectively means less jobs.\n\nAnyone who thinks AI has not helped them work more efficiently doesn't know how to utilize it properly.; How can you say this with confidence? How would you know and/or prove this…; Well ChatGPT did not cost me my job.

About once a month I am able to tease/coax ChatGPT into giving me a useful block of code. Most of the time I just end up forgetting about using it because it’s for the most part easier to do myself.; ChatGPT has cost many peoples' jobs. The big tech companies have done these mega layoffs to free up capital for GPUs and server farms to support their AI efforts. Sure, they aren't subbing chatbots for programmers, but the impact is still massive.; It’s actually kinda incredible how junior engineers like you, who has zero experiences in this field, can confidently declaring “**victory over AI**” after… 18 months. \n\nMan, Satya Nadella should have really consulted kids on /r/cscareerquestions before investing billions in OpenAI.

It's also normal to accrue it (X hours per pay period) over the year.  3 weeks is on the low side.  5+ is pretty uncommon in my experience, especially if you can roll it over.  Companies don't like to have all that liability on the books.  Sometimes you can earn more weeks of PTO with tenure.\n\nA lot of companies do \"unlimited\" these days, which for me means an unofficial floor of 4-5 weeks off.; As someone with experience, I wouldn't accept anything under 4 weeks.

C was once considered a *high* level language and \"real\" programmers should know ASM, or so the gatekeepers would claim. Then it was people saying that \"real\" programmers did manual memory management instead of relying on Java garbage collection. \"Real\" programmers used statically typed languages, not scripting ones.

Hell if you have over 3 yoe, DM me and I’ll give you a referral.; I used to but then I got burned by a bad referral who made me look bad and annoyed the shit out of me and all of the people who interviewed him.; I was referred by someone and got the job but they were alumni. \n\nI had a few conversations after connecting and had a call where I showed them my resume. They suggested a role and I asked if they could refer and they were happy to. \n\nNow that I'm working I do actually refer people if they are from my university and program. Generally I also know what courses they have taken so I feel comfortable in referring. I assume the one who referred me felt similarly.; >so they can tell you more about the role and refer you for the position.\n\nWhenever someone reaches out to me wanting \"information on the role\", I immediately assume they really don't care and are just using that as an excuse for a referral.\n\nI'm almost always right.; I work at AWS, on the referral form, they ask us if we really know and recommend the person, or it's just a casual one (can't remember the exact wording). I have referred a few people who I just met at some event.; I've only done referrals for people I can vouch for, but that's because I work at small companies where this is reputational risk of a bad referral. This isn't such an issue at large companies that have impersonal centralized portals for referrals.; I do not. Not a complete stranger anyway. If its someone I have some sort of previous relationship with (school, work, etc), then sure.\n\nWith that being said there are some (from both school and previous jobs) that I don't think I'd refer if asked.; My company offers $1k for referrals that land the job so yes.; if i met someone at a conference or meetup, i will have my recruiter contact them— but will be clear it’s not with a _recommendation_\n\nthis will get them an interview, but they’ll be on their own to actually prove they fit the role; I would check their CV and pass it on to HR and also add a comment in the mail saying that I got this through linkedin but I dont know this guy at all. This helps  HR as well as candidate."

I’m that desperate for a job. 7YOE, full stack and devops.; I'm also a TL (at a smaller company but with exec level visibility) and I average 20-25 hrs a week.  Being able to delegate some of the longer-term feature work to your team members is key.  I mostly just focus on coordination, design, interacting with clients and external partners, and the \"glue\" work that no one else wants to do but is necessary.  For example, the last thing I did was debug some gnarly SQL queries that feed into a strategically important piece of analysis.  This is also where having tenure pays off, because you already know how most things work and you can do things more efficiently.\n\nThe downside is that you can't really disappear for days at a time; you need to be responsive and stay on top of things, which buys you credibility.; Take a \"it is not a bug, it is a feature\" approach to this. \n\nI used to work quite a bit, and helped dozens of teams after hours whenever I felt like it. This resulted in stupid high velocity for my team, which ended up in everyone either getting a 20% raise or a promotion each year. When I took a month off for holidays, I came back to a dumpster fire of issues and nobody knew how to fix them. Once I analyzed the backlog, I noticed that almost all issues were similar to ones that I used to help others with nonstop, thus depriving them of a valuable learning opportunity. I was mandated to no longer offer after hours support nor answer team members queries in less than 8 business hours. \n\nThink of your approach as \"long term team development to ensure sustainable growth\".

   "Top Comments": "There’s a big difference between the IP (the code) itself, and the idea + the person who can implement it. I’ve had more success charging for the latter, they can steal the former. \n\nIf I were you I wouldn’t charge for what you’ve done, not outright at least. Count that as experience and familiarity with the project, and charge more going forward. \n\nFigure out if they want to bring you on as a employee or as a contractor. If contractor, double your expected hourly cost. So if you’re asking 40/hr as an employee, do 80/hr as a contractor. \n\nIf you’re wanting to start asking $36/hr and you’re assuming 6wks minimum, add $12/hr to you requested pay rate. You’ll make that $2880 back in those 6wks. \n\nOr just do $40/hr as an employee and hope it goes for months or forever. The nice thing about working on something you built is that you might actually enjoy the project. \n\nIf you were going to do this correctly, get IP forms and such signed. If you don’t and this is a type of project you’d like to do for decades, they could own the entire thing when you leave. ; 1. Determine your hourly rate. Google “average entry level software dev salary in <your area>, divide by 52 and again by 40.\n\n2. Multiply that hourly rate by how long the project took you. That’s your upfront fee. \n\n3. Ask the company about hiring you on a contract basis. They should already have systems for that in-place. Ask for the hourly rate you figured out above. \n\n4. Ask about the possibility of transitioning to a full-time position (either dev or sec) afterwards. ; It depends on your region, terms (do you own the code for example) and how you are desperate to need money, and eventually how this can boost your career (are they willing to hire you).\n\nI would say that since you developed a first version by yourself, it’s not interesting to gain experience solely on it. You should do it in exchange for average freelance pay or a career aspiration.; I would start at $100/hr; That also seems like a viable option. I guess it'll depend on what their requirements are to see if there's enough work for a few weeks, then just hourly might be fine. Thank you; It took me roughly 80 hours so that's $2,800 at $36 an hour. Seems kinda ballsy to ask for but that's not even including my teammates hours (they already have jobs so they're cool with me doing this).\n\nThank you for the concrete advice. Do you think I should lead with those points in my initial email or wait?; I own the code, and I'm in the Midwest near Chicago. I feel pessimistic about them hiring me but you're right I should freelance thanks; Just some perspective: $2,800 is not a huge sum of money for most organizations. We spend like $40k/year for a similar application. Think about the time your product will be saving them. \n\nI would begin the conversation with offering to sell them the source code as-is for a flat fee of $2,800. Explain how you reached that number. Then, I would say that if they want any modifications made (or need help getting it up and running in their environment) you’d be happy to work on a contract basis for $36/hr. It is very important to specify “contract basis” because if they’re paying you to work you’ll need the appropriate tax form when you file your taxes next year. Finally, as the conversation progresses, if you feel it turn more conversational I don’t think it would hurt to casually ask about the possibility of working at the company potentially. \n\nTake all this with a huge grain of salt - I’ve never been lucky enough to be in your position! This is just what makes sense to me. Good luck!; Having a blueprint for how to progress this definitely puts my mind at ease, thank you. Although I just realized its a medical company owned by a huge conglomerate so maybe I should ask even more lol"

Our 1/1's was essentially them going on and on and on about their own accomplishments. Not the worst flavor of toxicity, I put up with it, it just wasn't very pleasant.\n\nThe other was a hardcore micromanager. He didn't trust his engineers, he needed to be involved at every step of the process, he was doing code reviews, he was essentially acting as an IC. Culture is very important to me, so I wasn't a fan of what he turned the team in to, so I left.; There is a guy who has got it out for me on my team. Like literally something would go wrong and his first instinct would be to blame me, eventhough I had nothing to do with it. \n\nI told my Team lead that I cannot work with him if this goes on and it has not stopped. I am looking to make an internal switch soon so i dont have to deal with his antics.; Had a guy who literally did nothing on my team, he would constantly report that other coworkers were dumb and try to get people fired while putting in 0 effort. \n\nHe was there for over a year before management finally gave him the axe; Circa 2000. Screaming matches in the hall ways over code reviews because each person wanted the code done their way and anyone else's way is wrong.; Mean toxic twofaced lying narcissist DK total sack of shit. He constantly shit talks everyone to everyone else, lies, changes stories to make himself seem like a hero, takes credit for everyone else's work, will intentionally sabotage things just so he can swoop in and \"fix\" them, and then blames the sabotage on the people around him. Literally anything involving that guy is extra harder than it needs to be just because nobody wants to work with him.\n\nHe had one minor accomplishment like two decades ago, and has been sitting on his laurels since.\n\nManagement is exhausted with him, but doesn't want to fire him because he's getting older and they fear an age discrimination lawsuit will follow. My only hope is the bus factor, or a heart attack, catches up with that fat sack of shit.; Militant colourblind PM.  Would literally enrage at any mention of colour coding,  screen highlighting, etc.; PM decided to schedule my perfomance review and another colleagues' perfomance review at the same day. This coworker probably realized that we were both disputing for the same raise budget, so he decided to besmirch me at the anonymous review forms in every way possible, very mean comments and things that were very hurtful (even though it was anonymous, I could tell it was him since the squad is small, and you can often tell by sentence structures/grammar/etc). For some reason, he never spoke about those things to me, he would frequently ask me to help him with code, and even play games with him outside work hours. I felt so betrayed, nowadays I keep my distance and don't share anything about my RL with coworkers; New guy on the team would submit a pull request with his own \"bonus items\" (literally what he called them in the PR), adding extra \"features\" or unilaterally changing up stuff in code w/o any prior discussion, because he believed those contributions were \"enhancements\" and made the product \"more usable.\"  In GH PR discussions and on Slack, he would tactlessly call out other devs including one of the most senior and well-respected guys, letting anyone reading know why their code or idea was flawed and inferior to his approach.\n\nNo doubt, this guy seemed code-smart and appeared to have deep knowledge of the particular stack and framework, but it was super important to him that everyone knew about it.  I wondered how this guy got through the hiring process and what, if any, team environment he had worked in before.  Totally lacking in basic people skills and how to interact within a team context, not to mention completely delusional, thinking that his behavior would fly in any business environment.\n\nTo mgmt's credit, this guy was gone before the end of his probation period.; When I was a junior dev I had a toxic tech leader. Back then I used to develop in Apache Camel, a middleware framework based in Java. My job was to create small services to interconnect different APIs. \n\nBecause of my lack of experience my code contained a lot of bugs, when I delivered my work my tech lead became angry and scolded me, pointing out the faults in my code. While he was technically right his approach was a bit too aggressive. He even went to the point of sending me an email CCing his boss, the CTO, mentioning how lousy and unprofessional my job was and how I made him lose his time checking my terrible code.\n\nWhen I did my job well he simply said a dry \"Thanks\" while taking the credit for my job, but if my job contained any mistake it was usually my fault.\n\nAs a junior developer I used to get stuck very often, when I asked him for help he grudgingly helped me, although this was probably because he was too busy.\n\nOn one occasion I was taking longer than expected to deliver a service, when I finally was finished and told my TL he told me that he had already done my job for me and that it was already delivered to the client. I felt very upset because he never told me anything and he sent an entire day of my work to the trash.\n\nBecause of this situation I became depressed and anxious, aggravated by the social isolation caused by 2020 mandatory quarantine, and my performance dropped until the point that the CTO called me to explain why I was delivering so many services late. He made me write an email to my TL and to me apologizing for my low performance and promising to do it better in the following weeks. He failed to notice (And me too) that a demotivating work environment like that was hindering my performance; I've been lucky enough to never had to directly work directly with anyone I'd consider toxic.\n\nThe closest I can think of was at a previous job. It was a small company that had been around for a long time going through a sudden growth spurt. One of the tenured QA people apparently was known for screaming at people (often).\n\nMy manager in one of our first 1-1s brought up that while I don't work with him, if I ever have a negative encounter to let him know and he would handle it. I made it pretty clear I wasn't going to tolerate it if that ever happened and I am capable of addressing it myself.\n\nIt never happened, but I remember in one of the \"happy hour\" meetings we would periodically have one of the senior managers brought up his behavior and shrugged it off with \"but he's good at his job so what can we do?\"; [removed]; A manager I was on an interview with once ended the interview early and told the candidate we weren’t interested because the candidate had been struggling. I was literally speechless at how unprofessional it was and I still feel awful for the guy.; I had a very demeaning coworker, constantly treated me (3 yoe) like a stupid intern. Then again, most of the software engineers had masters and PhDs, said coworker included, and the few coworkers I did get along with got laid off shortly before me.; 20+ years of experience that seemed to have repeated year 4 15 times, never taking accountability, throwing teammates under the bus behind their backs, always whining about personal life, writes code like a college student (i.e. lacks organization and design), needs hand holding for all front-end related tasks (yet never gives thanks for the help), can't let someone talk without screaming \"Yeah, I already know that!\"\n\n\nWorst freaking teammate I've had in the professional world...the only redeeming quality about them was that they were very knowledgeable about stuff (like threading).; I'm pretty sure my ex boss for one company would come after few lines of coke, so yeah that wasn't fun... don't feel like going into details but it was a toxic work environment xD; They usually flock together, its either OK or there is quite a few of them. I had an experience when my  colleague\n1. Answered all questions with I want to do it / I want you to do it\n2. Did not merge prs, like one liner would take him 3 days to process\n3. We started with a lots of security issued with sla the guy told he wasn't interested in doing them.\n4. Refactored everything he sees (reason: I want to do it)\n\n\nCherry on top is manager who does not give a faq, only stare at you with compassion and telling how everything is gonna be alrighty. \n\n\nI left that place as soon as I've got my visa sorted out. That guy is still there, and the manager is still a manager. ; Rude racist know it all.; I just left a micromanaging boss. As a senior he would sometime ask me to send my emails to him first. He was in every storytime, stand-up etc talking over his team. He deleted a database so for 3 years he had to shoulder you for every production change and gate keep everything. It was just a nightmare. ; Realistically they don't care how he treats anyone else so long as he hits kpi metrics.; Oof"

There’s no “should.”\n\nIf you want to work on a project over summer, that’s good. Someone else’s project that you mention is fine, but I’ll tell you it’s going to suck to do.\n\nThe best answer is to think of an idea for something you want to do, and create a feature-rich and fully-fleshed out product (obviously knowing “fully-fleshed out” can take a whole team years to do, you don’t need to finish and turn it into a business). You’ll learn way more about everything and distinguish yourself from everyone else that way as opposed to just trying to check a box by making a calculator.\n\nBasically, make something useful.

   "Title": "Moving across the country for Big N?",
   "Top Comments": "> If I decided to move, I would be planning on coming back\n\n\nThat's what we all said; A 15% TC bump is nowhere near enough to justify uprooting your life and moving cross-country.\n\nBased on these pay numbers it sounds like you’d be joining at college-hire level. Get some more work experience, decide where you want to establish your roots, and then apply to Big Tech as an experienced industry hire where those companies will *really* make it worth your while.; Honestly, the comp boost isn't huge, and FAANG isn't as big of a step up if you already have a F500. If your SO was willing to move with you, or you were *very* confident in your ability to work things out long-distance, I'd say take the FAANG offer. If neither, you're in a perfectly fine spot anyway and it's not mistake to stick around. FAANG will still be there, and if you can get an offer once you can do it again.; One thing I don't see mentioned here is that salary trajectory at a large tech company vs. a F500 is very different. I switched from F500 finance -> F500 Bank SWE -> FAANG SWE. Non-tech is slow to promote and pay-bands are paltry compared to tech. I've seen quite a few L3 engineers in a large tech company get promoted to L4 within a year. An L4 at [netflix ](https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=American%20Express,Netflix&track=Software%20Engineer)gets paid more than a director (6/7 levels up from new grad) at my old company. You will get a 15% pay bump, and after a promotion in a year or so, you will be making double that.\n\nSwitching from a large F500 to Tech company at mid level is much more difficult than getting in as a new grad, from my experience and observation. Don't simply consider what you will be making immediately after moving, also think about what your career will look like in a few years. I would recommend you take Big N, but of course your decision needs to be weighted against leaving your SO, friends, and family.; Nah; FAANG companies are massive and we reject candidates with FAANG experience all of the time. Don’t over value simply having the name on your resume. Do you know what team you would be joining? Compare that work to the work you’re doing now. \n\nThe money is slightly better, but compare the cost of living in wherever you will need to live. \n\nYou will likely be giving up the relationship you have with your SO, so you have to factor that in too. \n\nOverall it’s a tough one.; > As another comment said, I'm fresh out of college so I'm thinking in terms of long term benefit here, and if getting into big tech earlier, especially since the new grad process is much easier, will benefit me that much more.\n\nAs another comment said, I'm fresh out of college so I'm trying to think of my long term growth. I understand that getting into big tech is easier the sooner out of college you are, but aside from that will that early experience at a larger tech company benefit me that much more if I start earlier as opposed to later?; For 200k a year base, I'd consider. Going from 130k TC to 150k.... Not worth it in my opinion.; Can I DM and ask about your trajectory?; Thanks for your answer. Moving to tech would definitely be my longer term goal since I don't want to be pigeon-holed in finance, and I would be able to connect with a lot more people in the tech industry compared to now. Unfortunately since it's a new grad position I only know of my overarching org and won't know my actual team until closer to the start date.\n\nAt my current position I have a lot more ownership over my work, but the product is for internal users only.\n\nI currently live in a HCOL area, so the COL would be pretty comparable.\n\nI do not want to give up the relationship, so we will be trying out absolute best to make it work, with plans for me to go back after a short amount of time. I do acknowledge that this will be tough.\n\nThe short term TC increase isn't really that much of a factor for me, but in terms of long term growth, will big tech be that much more beneficial in terms of opening doors?; But small companies prioritize FAANG branded resumes. ; As another comment said, I'm fresh out of college so I'm thinking in terms of long term benefit here, and if getting into big tech earlier, especially since the new grad process is much easier, will benefit me that much more.; Yeah sure; Being pigeon holed is over exaggerated. I’ve worked in defense, finance, insurance, unicorn start ups, etc. The important part was what was I actually accomplishing in my role. \n\nWithout knowing the team you’re taking a pretty big gamble. Being young and new is a good time to take gambles with your career though. I definitely wouldn’t assume that your new role will automatically be an external product. There are so many more internal product teams. \n\nLiving on the other side of the country for an indefinite amount of time is going to be extremely unlikely to work. \n\nHard to say. Like I said, there are so many candidates with FAANG experience that it itself isn’t a big differentiator. I see Amazon/AWS on basically every third resume."

I didn't see a single person point out that OP might just be depressed, and would probably love scripting a webscraper if they weren't depressed.; It was a joke, in the old days the saying was \"Google it\" but these days everyone just uses chat gpt; It was a joke, I could have said 'Google it'; i know plenty people in the industry who dont enjoy the learning, and are not depressed, they just dont gravitate towards the learning part, in my opinion it makes them less likely to become good obviously, but thats their problem, nothing to do with being depressed at all, wild take.; 12 years coding, 22 years total in the IT industry, the learning process has always been the worst part (if you exclude on-call..); I'm not totally sure that the learning process can actually work without the dopamine feedback, though.

Literally skipped COVID thank fucking god. \n\nIt’s not easier to become a doctor you have to be top of your class in undergrad, then try hard to be top of your class in med school, then try hard top in your residency program, then fellowship if you want to make the big bucks, etc. \n\nIt’s stressful as fuck until you finish residency after 12-15 years of studying you can finally make 200-300K if you’re mediocre or 300K+ if you were top of your class and top of your programs and chose the right specialty.\n\nYou’re drowning in debt overworked and underpaid for over a decade. A 22 year old CS grad can accumulate over $1mil from age 22-32 if they’re actually good, and there’s a lot less ground to cover in software to become good. It was much harder to become a doctor than self study a complete bachelor’s of CS.; 'once you pass all the tests'\n\nlet me tell you about a close friend of mine, a medical student.\n\n4.0 High school GPA, w/ high placement in state competitions in her sport. Super high SAT/ACT scores from constant test preparation and helicopter parents. This secures her a college admission at an esteemed school (not Top 10 by any means, but really good nonetheless).\n\nFinished high school. Off to college. Chose a degree program in Biomedical Engineering. Was constantly on the hunt for shadowing opportunities, pestering graduate level students and professors to allow her to help contribute to research, just to get a more attractive med school application. Going to conferences and networking with people to create positive professional relationships that will help years down the line. Drafted and prototyped special prosthetics for amputees as a part of her biomedical engineering major. Studied 8-12 hours a day for months before the MCAT. Got a good MCAT score, and channeled all the prior 8 years' of effort into a hopefully good med school application. Luckily, it paid off, and she got accepted to med school.\n\nShe moved to be close to med school, and over the next 4 years, the same sort of process repeated. Constant opportunity seeking to create yet another portfolio, this time centered on residency applications. She's at year 3 of that so far. Here's all that's happened in the past 3 years:\n\n- 10-12 hour shifts at the hospital for all the core rotations (each lasting two weeks to a month, sometimes night shifts), for 6+ months straight (maybe a week's downtime between rotations, where you are doing school assignments)\n- STEP 1 & STEP 2 board exams. Studied her ass off for 2 months straight before each exam, again for 8-10 hours a day. The first one is pass-fail, the second one is graded and is heavily influential on getting into residency.\n- Positioned herself to become an administrator of an internationally  recognized [disease] advocacy group.\n- the negative \"school stuff\" in general, like optional lectures that aren't really optional, cutthroat classmates, etc\n- constantly on the hunt for more opportunities\n\nThis is all in preparation for getting into a good residency program. She's not expecting to be competitive for the \"top tier\" programs in the discipline she wants to go into. She thinks she'll be good enough to get matched into a residency at some pretty acclaimed programs, though. \n\nSo on the horizon, she has dozens residency applications to fill out, and will be travelling the country doing interviews sometime 6 months from now. Over the next 4 months she'll be doing several external rotations in places around country that she got admission to, which increases your chances of getting into residency in those locations. Each lasts about a month.\n\nOnce she matches, she'll be starting out w/ a 60k salary doing 80-120 hour weeks.\n\n10+ years of preparation to do her calling, which is surgery.\n\nBut sure, it's \"just passing exams\", if you say so\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention the tuition, lmao; In what world is medicine an easier path than technology?  \n\nThere’s almost no barrier to entry in tech.    \n\nTo be a doctor, you need to take the MCAT, apply for med school, med school, residency, fellowship, medical boards, etc. ; Nope.\n\n>It's going to a long time before robots are extracting teeth or performing surgery.\n\nIt's super interesting to me that people fear monger about an AGI that can completely replace SWE's, but they can't fathom a world where that exact same AGI can integrate with robotics and replace surgeons.\n\nI think this future is a lot closer than you realize.; Nope, biological stuff grosses me out.

Personally I have never seen someone with a potential to be a doctor choose this field.; Lol half of all medical school applicants aren’t admitted to a single medical school.\n\nDepression rates for doctors are high and working 60 hour weeks doesn’t help. No guarantee you get a clinical rotation or residency in the actual kind of medicine you want to practice.

Do you know anyone who went through med school and residency?; What? No, sorry, this is a crazy take not grounded in reality even for this sub.\n\nFor starters, do you have any idea how hard the training is as a doctor? You have to study mind-numbing amounts of material, attend classes/labs/clinical courses with military-like discipline for 6 years and take on insane levels of responsibility. That's just to 'pass all the tests' and get your medical license (at least how it works in some places). Then you have to pick a field and start a residency that might take another 4-7 years depending on the field, and even possibly do some time in rural practice before that. Oh, did I mention that a lot of doctors also do Master's and PhDs during that timeframe -- just to get a little bit ahead?\n\nYou are deluding yourself if you think it is less competitive when in fact CS doesn't even *compare*, just because they don't have to do typical bullshit interviews. White board tests and HR screen sound like fun compared to what you have to go through to be a decent-ish doctor. I'm not even going to go into what their day-to-day work entails where the worse that can happen to a SWE is a boring meeting that takes too long.; To be honest, I wish more people aspired to become doctors than software engineers.

She has 2 part-time jobs right now.\n\nWhen I watch my doctor do his job, it doesn’t look like fun.  He’s stuck in an office all day.  Seeing patients looks a lot like working at a retail store.; I was in healthcare and got to experience some medical school classes. I get why people romanticize being a doctor but it doesn't make much sense if you're approaching it from the perspective of an aspiring dev who's scared of not having a job.\n\n- Medical debt\n\n- More Time lost in education(4 years BS + ~4 years medical school + residency)\n\n- MCAT grind replaces Leetcode grind\n\n- Additional hours required for volunteering/shadowing/experience for your application\n\n-  Different learning skills required (gigantic amount of memorization)\n\n- Varies from specialization to specialization, but many specializations have huge stress/workload\n\nIf all you care about is guaranteed TC at a given point then it might be better since you'll probably make more than a random dev after residency. But I'd argue it takes way more work and more time, and that's if you have the aptitude to choose either the medical route or dev route (which require different skillsets); Lmao yeah it’s so much easier have nearly another decade of training and schooling along with hundreds of thousands in debt.; Lol no. \n\nA few reasons:\n- Wlb sucks for most doctor specialties\n- It takes like 12+ years of preparation (and a 6 figure debt in the US) to get to the point where you make 250k in medicine. With a successful career in CS, you could have hundreds of thousands in net worth by that point in life. By the point in life where a typical doctor is getting to a net worth of 0, a successful SWE could be considering things like early retirement, etc.\n- It's fun to have good income while being young.\n- I never enjoyed biology related classes in high school / college, it was a lot ot memorizing (which I hated), I prefer things that are more logic-based (like cs).\n- Honestly, I don't want to be responsible for other people's lives."

Cries in Canadian.\n\n- Assuming same geo, the answer is almost always, with a tiny bit of room for exceptions because at many (most?) places, the very top bound of Lx > the very bottom bound of L(x + 1).\n\n- You only mentioned level and performance. Besides level, perf, and geo, there are other factors which are important in determining comp: negotiation skills (determining initial comp) and soft skills/knowing how to manage office politics (determining review results, which determine raises).\n\n- There's often a huge bump from senior to staff/principal/whatever, with equivalent bump in expectations. It's really a different type of role and a different set of expectations; you're no longer just \"getting better\" at pumping out features.; In the same company + location + role, salaries often fall within the pay bands for each level; there may be some overlap and [outliers](https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-says-google-paid-4x-to-employee-he-was-looking-to-hire-101708067834743.html)\n\nPerformance may not be reflected in salaries either — it's pretty common for an external hire to make more than someone promoted internally at the same level (even if the new hire sucks and the existing employee is a top performer); The Level System is a linear scale. However, I have seen a tech Lead making more than the director at a startup. Even though the director is technically top tier. As well as a regular employee from data science who moved into data engineering making more than all of us in DE. \n\nSo each point on the scale has a range and that range depends on, time with the company, contributions to work, etc. but there are certainly caveats and exceptions. If something’s not lining up, more likely it’s the exception and not a difference in understanding.; Salary bands usually overlap on the top of a level and the bottom of the next level. When promoted you should move into the bottom of the next band so there's room to increase in band year over year until your next promotion.\n\nAt FAANG level increases total comp exponentially. Every level increases total comp by about 50%.\n\nAt startups where it's comp is more ... closed ... anything goes. Generally whoever can negotiate better will get paid more until the company matures to the point of taking a serious look at how their comp works across all roles and levels.; Not always, but likely.\n\nMost companies have some overlap in bands... and for non FAANG type firms it is non-zero.\n\nThe top L1 will earn more than the bottom L2.  But, most L2s will out earn the top L1.\n\nAlso, if you get promoted and are low in band.  Often there is a bump in the first review to bring you more into the band.; Bands normally overlap so it is possible of someone more junior earning more.\n\nFor example:\n- L1 is 35k-45k\n- L2 is 40k-50k\n- L3 is 45k-55k\n\nMost companies try and start people towards the bottom of a band.\n\nThen aim to promote up to the middle point and then likely a promotion so up to the bottom of the next level.\n\nMaybe someone is good to get higher start in a band, or maybe for technical reasons they can’t promote to L3 so they go above the middle.\n\nA bad L3 might only ever get yearly bumps which will be quite small whereas someone else lower might get a 5K pay rise as they are really good.\n\nThere are bonuses to consider too.\n\nLet’s imagine L3 is a senior here, maybe company has a bonus for seniors and above so total comp is higher too.; Some what.; Salary bands based on level/title, if they exist, are hard caps. Doesn't matter how good you are, if you're L2 your max is the max for L2. If you can't get bumped up a level, you're stuck.\n\nI'm dealing with this sort of thing right now myself.; What kind of brainrot question is this?; Holy cow! Imagine getting a 4x rise all of a sudden from none other than Google. Talk about an ego boost; There are exceptions for everything. Especially at higher levels.; Hate it for you man. Hope you end up getting what you want. Thanks for sharing."

In fact. make sure you give yourself ample time to get to the airport. Meaning, don’t just ask to leave that hour early.

Give a heads up in advance and you should be fine.; Ask 2 weeks before the flight and offer to come in an hour early that day. Shouldn't be a big deal. A lot of companies let you set your own hours so long as you work 8 and are on during core hours (10-3). For example, my company lets met come in 7-3, or 9-5, or 8-4, or anything in between.; Don't get into the habit of *asking* for time off. You should announce that you plan to take time off. If there's a reason to be concerned about that having some impact, you should announce time off and immediately offer to help arrange coverage or whatever is applicable. In your case, I wouldn't bring it up at all until a week or two before the time, and then just mention it in the appropriate context. Drop a note in Slack saying \"I'll be leaving early on Thursday\", or mention it the week before during a meeting, or put it in your calendar and drop a note to your boss a week or so out.\n\nAdults should never be *asking* for time off. They should be notifying and accommodating. If your schedule is flexible, by all means accompany your announcement with an offer to reschedule to a better time. But don't ask.

I asked my manager if I could leave early as long as I put in 40 hours, and got an easy/quick \"of course\". Every Friday I'd leave super early so I could drive back home for the weekend. Most people are understanding and reasonable. They, too, have their own plans and accommodations.; Just work an extra hour in the morning to make up for it; Just leave an hour early as it won't be a big deal.  But if it does bother you, you can always show up an hour early to compensate. Or make up the hour the previous or next day.; Do you even know if the company has a 9 to 5 policy?; Yes, absolutely.

   "Top Comments": "Github Copilot Chat has been the greatest learning tool for me.  After reading docs, and asking questions in groups, I never thought I was getting very far.  Now, I have discussions with AI, and have advanced much faster.  You can ask how to do something, why, and even why it didn't work your way.  And it never makes me feel as stupid as people in Stack Overflow did.  Chat GPT works too I guess.; Lots of engineers are absolute shit at communicating and it very much comes out in documentation. I've met very few engineers who write well. Usually the document they add just makes things more complicated and/or regurgitates everything you can clearly already see from the code. Basically, internal documents are usually completely worthless. They exist to check a box rather than provide any value, unfortunately.; It is normal for company/internal docs to be poor in quality. It's also not uncommon for libraries to have documentation errors and mistakes.\n\n\nHowever, I think that you should have at least some comprehension in order to identify these problems. Poor documentation shouldn't be hindering you from learning!\n\n\nBut depending on what is poorly documented, it absolutely can cost days or occasionally a week or two of productivity. Do your best to resolve your blind spots quickly -- even if it's out of your control, losing weeks to just one obstacle can look really bad to some employers.\n\n\nIt isn't uncommon to spend a couple days resolving issues, especially if the documentation you're working from is limited.; My previous career was in academia. Writing good documentation, and teaching, have a lot of overlap.\n\nWhen you are an expert at a thing, it is incredibly easy to take certain things for granted as general knowledge. \"Obviously they know X thing! It's so basic, no need to include it\" but when teaching or writing documentation, you absolutely _do_ need to include those little things.\n\nIt's a skill that takes focused and intentional practice... but it's often instead just an afterthought, so you get incomplete explanations that leave things out, or are organized in weird ways.\n\nEdit to add: all this is to say, don't feel too bad about not understanding things right away. Ask those questions you think are \"dumb questions\". Whoever wrote those docs probably legitimately left something out.; Do you have this same problem reading official technology docs and not docs related to your company? Although even then there is a learning curve, especially since all docs are written differently and often they aren't written with every situation in mind.; Not uncommon for team documentation to suck, especially because most orgs don't place a lot of value in things that don't directly and quickly make them money. It's also not uncommon for developers to need improvement in the area of written communication.\n\n\nI'd strongly recommend setting up a quick touchbase meeting if you're really confused about something. Eventually, things will click and you'll become more independent. Politely highlighting the ambiguity in documentation/messages that confused you might even encourage your team to do better with how they convey information.; I feel your pain here. In fact, my own TechLead back at Google actually acknowledged that while I'm not the most technically savvy engineer, I'm write incredibly well. I've had other engineers share similar feedback to, and I'm honestly jarred at how atrociously many of us in our industry write or attempt to explain difficult concepts to readers unfamiliar with pre-existing context. I think years of academic training coupled with a voracious childhood reading habit led me to my current position, and I honestly wished that more of us in the tech industry learnt the skills of effective writing, strong communication, and proper rhetoric to justify technical decisions, design decisions, and other corporation decisions.; You are correct. Most people explain things very poorly.\n\nThe most common way things are explained poorly is when examples are provided but definitions/reasons for doing so are never given.\n\nLearner: \"What is inheritance?\"\n\nAnswerer: \"It's like how a sedan is a type of car.\"\n\nLearner: \"What?\"\n\nAnswerer: \"For example, like how a monkey is a type of mammal, the monkey inherits from mammal\"\n\nLearner: \"So is this like a subset of something else?\"\n\nAnswerer: \"Not really. Here, let me give you another example.\"\n\nIt's clearly indicative of people speaking from their memory and perspective without considering their audience -- you.; Writing (and maintaining) good documentation takes skiill and time.  Even when someone is a good writer/explainer, it is often not prioritized by teams with busy schedules.\n\nAnd even when documentation is good, it’s hard to avoid the problem that every topic, in order to be well understood, depends on several other topics or bits of relevant context.  Writing documentation that allows a newbie to self-manage browsing that web of pre-requisites smoothly is especially difficult and time-consuming.\n\nAnd answering on-the-fly questions from a newbie, and guessing which pre-requisites they’re missing, is harder.  \n\nIt’s normal for learning to be an iterative process with lots of clarifying questions.; I'm actually a pretty good technical writer as well as a competent software developer - I have a few professional publications that have been well received.  I am _capable_ of writing comprehensible documentation that communicates what you need to know in order to understand how to extend and maintain a bit of software that you may find yourself responsible for.  I've never worked in an organization that made that possible.  They always demand that documentation follow a specific (completely useless) template, not be \"too technical\" or \"too abstract\", be reviewed by idiots who insist on making changes that only make sense to people who were in one specific meeting on one specific day (and don't understand what I'm writing anyway).  You're just dealing with BigCo stupidity here, and it's going to be with you for the rest of your career.; No you’re not bad at understanding but people aren’t bad at explaining things either. My experience with learning programming was just like yours at first. Not a lot made sense from any documentation or explanations from instructors. I just kept reading and kept writing code, sometimes the same operation in different ways. Trusted documentation, I would read over and over and I still refer to them now and learn something new from something I’ve read a dozen or more times over the past number of years since I started learning software development. Be patient with yourself and let the information sink in when it sinks in and don’t expect to understand everything the first time around. I specifically remember learning how to write FizzBuzz in JavaScript about a month before I understood how the code worked. \n\nYou’re doing alright, just keep going!; In response to your comment on asking questions to peers: When I was a new hire, my mentor told me I wasn’t going to get my hand held. She intentionally didn’t give me crucial information, which led me to spin my wheels. She was the tech lead and failed to mention we had a team overseas working on a dependency. It wasn’t even documented in the epic. Although I was embarrassed, I learned a lot from that experience.\n\nAnother experienced dev took me under his wing. He reaches out even when I don’t ask for help and when I told him how grateful I was, all he asked was that I pay it forward when others need it.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is, sometimes people intentionally leave information out for whatever reason. Learn to build relationships. Don’t feel bad for asking clarifying questions but try to be as independent as possible.; Most people are terrible at explaining things. That's why I can make money as a business analyst.; My team has amazing documentation, but guess what? \n\nI wrote it.\n\nAll 100+ pages that cover every single aspect.\n* onboarding\n* domain knowledge\n* architecture\n* operation run-books\n* etc\n\n\nI got tired of nothing being documented. \n\nEveryone uses my stuff, but nobody else updates it. Developer simply suck at writing.; Most people's writing skills border on illiteracy. I get incomprehensible emails all day long.; My team requires most design/architecture changes to be documented which most people aren't going to spend a lot of time or effort doing. And typically the documentation assumes you already know the process and you just need the details.\n\nIf there are a lot of things you want to clarify or ask just schedule a call, and make sure you have everything ready to discuss before hand. No one wants to spend 30 minutes in a back and forth conversation that could take 5 minutes discussing in a call.; Internal documentation almost always sucks.\n\nPeople don't like to put time into it, moreover you need to keep them up-to-date once you write the initial copy. That results in poor docs.\n\nAs solutions, Use smth like Copilot or ReadDocs to extract things you need from those docs.\n\nAnd, ask your team to use smth like supacodes.com to automate internal documentation, so docs can be automatically written and updated.; Everyone has different experiences and understand things differently. I would never expect everyone to ask the same amount of questions.\n\nI personally like working with the person who asks more questions. It helps me understand what he doesn't know and I can help more effectively.\n\nI like this so much that I took on a JR developer who asked the most questions and everyone thought that he was the most behind. This kid basically does all the work now and I just have to manage the work coming in and keep him away from all the noise and meetings. Everything is always on fire, but he doesn't need to know that.\n\nPlease keep asking questions.; This is exactly why you learn diagramming in your CS degrees. Any existing complicated logic or structure should have an associated diagram in the docs. If your coworker is trying to show you something they’re working on or giving you advice on something, you should both go to a whiteboard and spend a little bit of time drawing out your thoughts. Everyone has difficulty getting a whole ton of complicated logic dumped on them verbally; People intentionally write bad docs to improve their job security\n\nYou're not compensated to doc well."

A master's degree in ML is only useful if you publish in a top conference. If not you're better off getting work experience.; A Master's Degree does nothing for your iOS dev career. If you like this path, continue working on your interesting projects, leverage them to make connections with other folks, and don't bother with any further qualification.; I'm on iOS side.\n\nLet's begin telling you that I specialized in machine learning during my master, back then it was cool, a lot of fun activities, challenges, in general I had really a lot of fun with my colleagues. Then I entered the job market.\n\nPeople from every background tries to land a job in the field because it's well paying and because it's cool (mostly because of this, because in academia the field is overhyped), companies having an insane amount of applicants for each of those roles tend to pay a bit less the junior roles and many of the industry ML algorithms are just \"picking one or two good algorithms and applying them black box to 90% of the problems\".  \nMoreover, Data Scientist roles, as they're nowadays intended have become less and less technical, which after pursuing a degree in engineering was a bit delusional.\n\nOnce I faced the reality of things I chose to pivot to a different role, but if I could go back I would have specialized in something completely different during my master.\n\nSo my personal advice is, do whatever you please the most as a specialization, ML could always come in handy, even in iOS development, but in the end I'd stick with a path you're already know and like. Because unless you're working in top tier companies ML is boring as fuck under the technical point of view.; iOS; consider pivoting while working as an iOS developer, if your current company has ML roles etc.; Getting a job in Machine learning/Data Science field is very hard even with a MS (in current market, could be different in future). IMO iOS developer is much safer path than ML. You could do some ML projects or take some free course to gauge the career and see how you like it. A degree in general SWE would be way better for your career. Your work experience in iOS development would also go a long way for your career.\n\nAlso, you don't get to do a lot of math or stats in DS/ML career you just import libraries with ML algorithms already implemented and use those. There are some roles where you do math/stats stuff but those are few and far between. If you go for a career in academia then you'll use lots of math/stats but that's a whole different conversation.; ML"

I have used python extensively professionaly, but not in a server/client context, more a data engineering one.\n\nIm looking to make a full stack application as a side project, and am wondering what would be best while using free IDEs for the backend. I would like to use angular on the front end, as I am somewhat familiar with it and would not like to learn a new frontend framework/language.\n\nIt seems to me that c# and java have a lot of dependencies, build and config files that may be too much of a barrier to entry to get the web app even running.\n\nI have not used C++ for server code, and I am wondering if python may be the best move. The only concern I have with python is that it does not truly support multithreading, something I would like to use.\n\nThe basic idea for the project is to start off as an app that displays market data for a given tradable instrument via a connection to an exchange on the backend. From there I would like to add some customizable tradebot logic.\n\nWould using python for this project be too primitive? If so, what language/framework would you recommend for the backend with little cost as far as even getting the webserver setup?; Daily rant, \n\nDon't know anymore. Applied to so many jobs, gotten so many interviews but none seem to give me back an offer. There are so many recruiters who reached out to me, never progressed and then ghosted me, like what is wrong with them? \n\nI get that the job market is bad, but some interviews like hirevue or just normal interviews i really just don't get the hiring criteria. I have failed 15 min phone calls and hard interviews that i thought i did really well in, just don't have a single clue what these companies are looking for anymore... \n\nI am the problem, what am i actually doing wrong?; This really depends on you. The Helpdesk could still be a good job to have while applying especially if you enjoy being around your college campus. Plus many help desk jobs have a lot of downtime that you could spend doing stuff to find or prepare for a job; I think most of the time it's just for statistical purposes, like the company has to report to some regulatory agency what % of applicants are disabled. my current company goes out of their way to make the office ADA complaint (not that it matters bc we are a remote first company) and they still ask that question. in our case at least it's definitely not to try to bias for or against disabled candidates.\n\nif you put prefer not to respond it shouldn't hurt your application at all but I also don't think there's any benefit. if some employer would actually treat a \"yes\" as a negative I'm almost sure they would treat \"prefer not to respond\" also as a negative.; The university program is all online so I dont have access to the campus itself. Are help desk roles really so heavy on downtime that ill be able to work on personal projects during them?\n\nSorry for more questions, im just worried that the career center pointing me towords entry IT is just a more polite way of telling me im fucked and Ive been in a bit of a panic for the last few days about it."

During the phone screen I was asked about salary expectations and I said 5k$ a month, the recruiter responded that they are not offering as much for junior roles and the offer would probably won't exceed 4k$ a month and asked if I was still interested to continue to which I obviously said yes. I am expecting to be asked salary expectations again at the next interview except now I am uncertain how to respond and if I should try negotiating if offered lower then 4k, any advice?; What to wear to job interview?\n\nI'm an older gentleman that has been in automotive engineering for over 20 years. I was looking to get out of automotive and into a general IT type role to avoid all the travel. I just landed an interview for a Computer Technician job. It seems effectively a Tier I type position.\n\nIt may seem weird to ask, but what is proper attire for such an interview? Is a suit appropriate? Or business casual, khaki's and button down shirt? I don't want to overdress or underdress. I haven't had an actual interview outside of automotive for 20 years, so I'm not sure what is appropriate?; Do your research to figure out what you're worth overall. One solution is connect with another person doing a similar role and ask their salary.; Now adays, I wear a blazer with nice dress shirt and jeans.  I wouldnt go more casual than that even if they said you could.\n\nI despise ties which is one of the main reasons i avoid suits; General rule is one level above what you'd wear to work there. A suit could be overkill for a computer technician, but slacks and button down (sans tie) are a safe bet.\n\n  \nAlternatively, look at the company website or video, find a stock photo of an employee, and dress like him.; Thanks, yeah. The rep did say it's casual, so I'll probably wear Dockers and button down shirt and a blazer. I despise suits and ties as well. Plus I have to buy something because I have had zero need to wear such clothes for a long time, and might as well buy something that I can at least wear again."

   "Top Comments": "What’s unique about this other team?\n\nIt’s important to be talking with your manager about your career goals on a regular basis. That’s not the same as asking to leave your team. It’s about working with them to make a plan to get you where you want to go.\n\nHow possible it is to change teams in your exact situation varies tremendously across companies. It’s hard to say it’s possible or not; Do you think anything bad will happen if you ask?; [removed]; It’s about risk taking. There are risks moving teams even within companies that openly support this. I have moved a few times, and also saw other folks do it. If I were you, I’d first find who can support my move (managers, skip levels, staff, other peers in the destination team) - this is important to make sure someone will have your back if you decide to move. I’d also write down a plan on how to deliver the remaining work I have on my plate (prior to the move) and share this with my manager the day I speak to him - this will show them you’re thinking about completing your stuff and not simply leaving.\n\nIf there is a way to guarantee (to some extend) your spot is granted on the new team, that would be reduce risks greatly.\n\nIf your manager and team likes you and value your work, they will support you no matter what. Just be mindful if they don’t support you 100%, that’s still ok, because they will have to deal with your departure as well.; I wouldn’t even ask before the 2 year mark.

There are firms that will hire Senior SWEs to run Full Stack teams at ~340k (this would be an L5 at Google or L6 at Amazon), but these people aren't hired because they know \"Full Stack\" right. They're hired because they have strong system design skills and can break down a complex project to get some system up to speed - even leading some junior devs if needed.; Mainly the economy and competitive job market. In a couple years when the market back up it would be easier, but it will difficult to land one for sure. Again I’m not saying it is impossible, so give it a try if you think you are the top 0.1 percent developer.; If you wern't born in the US, then you're an immigrant.

Are you good at writing system design docs? If you can practice your English enough for technical interviews, I don't see why not.; I have no issue with immigrants, but I'm watching so many born here lose their jobs that I just get sad some days.\n\nWith DEI and other measures, it's really difficult to get hired right now.

   "Top Comments": "I don't think there's much consistency, it really depends on the company. As others said, government work is probably different since it's much more regulated, but in private sector I think you just need to ask the right questions in the interview to figure out what the company is like. ; > I've been doing it for almost 2 years, with 4 yoe total now, with a lot of pressure to take more responsibility on ( I'm up for senior this year according to my manager ).\n\nI wish you had been more specific which FAANG, because at Amazon or Google senior in 4 years would mean you're \"choosing\" to overwork yourself since mid level is terminal. While in comparison I believe at Meta senior is required in about that time frame.\n\nSo if you're somewhere mid level is terminal, and you're going up for senior promo in 4 years I wouldn't recommend leaving, because you'll likely have the same issue. You need to realize you're not at risk at getting fired, you need to slow down to avoid burn out, and if you miss a deadline so be it. Just communicate it well. Even when I was at defense contractors if I had hit every deadline I was asked to hit I would have been overworked.; I’m at a FAANG and thankfully don’t work more than 40-45 hours a week. I don’t want my team (mids and seniors) to work more than that either. \n\nI know not all parts of our company have the same W/B, maybe we’re lucky; It’s interesting to me how wildly different everyone’s experience is. I’ve probably only had 10 weeks where I’ve worked over 40 hours in the last 6 years.\n\nMaybe I got lucky but I’ve worked for the DoD and an insurance company. Both are pretty chill jobs. Most people I worked with also didn’t work over 40 hours. I know a lot of federal agencies need computer scientists and they’ll get you whatever clearance you need. \n\nThe military lab near me is desperate for people and has decent work life balance if you’re cool with going in person 50% of the time. I’d look into labs/ bases around you or contractors.; In interviews, I would ask about on calls, how are bugs handled, size of team vs expected project size or scope, and how long the current roadmap is for the team\n\nDefinitely consider non-tech companies and mid-size companies. Sometimes they'll surprise you with what they can offer, but the perks obviously won't be as nice as the cushiest of FAANG perks.; My friend, the second my evaluation was over and was offered a permanent position in my first company was the second my personal and professional lives separated.     \nI used to code just for the exploration and fun of it. The moment people started paying  me to do it, everything I usually did at home I transferred to work. (but now for MONEY!)

Would almost certainly be a pay cut, but a practical guarantee you wouldn’t be working over 80. \n\nWouldn’t recommend being a government employee though.; [removed]; [removed]; Going for senior calls for larger impact, not more work. If you want to take on new responsibilities, some of the old ones need to go to someone else, or not get done. I hope you can have a conversation with your manager or skip about the burnout.

So most people prefer staying at their current company — even if it means being paid slightly less. \n\nNot to mention that sometimes company culture can be a downgrade from the current company. People are just afraid and unsure about switching companies — so corporations usually have the ability to lower their SWE’s salary by a bit.; Why pay a high salary when you don't value top-notch software and just need something that works well enough delivered close enough to deadlines?; Some companies just don't need the top quality engineers. They just want mediocre engineers who can maintain their commodity software to keep their business humming along. So, they only pay enough to attract such engineers. Some also have excellent work life balance, in a way that people are willing to not move at all; [removed]; I worked for a non profit. They just pay less because they say don't have money. But our team used to make the company money. Lol . \n\n\nThey will find any reason to underpay you. \n\n\nTrying to understand it will be like asking your ex why they cheated. They will give you some bullshit that don't make sense.; Hanlon's razor: \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity\" \n\n\nAs it turns out, running a business is hard and many fledgling business owners don't actually know industry standards for every aspect of a business, including average salaries for specializations other than their own.\n\n\nSWE comp in the US also varies wildly depending on location, industry, revenue size, etc. Also, averages are exactly that: averages. Junior comp, for example, is almost by definition supposed to be below average (with some outlier exceptions) just from a pure stats 101 standpoint.; Half of the posts on this reddit are people graduating from bootcamps and being unable to find a job...; My first dev job was massively underpaid.  They tried to make up for it with a pretty dope culture, but when COVID happened, they went full remote and that killed the culture.  There was a mass exodus as people realized they could just get a new remote job that paid over twice as much, and they weren't losing much since they were already working from home.  Somehow they managed to limp by until now, but I heard recently that they are closing shop now.\n\nThe culture thing worked for a long time.  The company was founded by a group of friend around 2010, and then it grew from there.  So they came into it with an established culture, and it was a good one.  tbh, that was the most fun I've ever had at a job, but of course that wears off after a while, and then it's just an underpaid job.; Companies exist to earn profit for the company owners. Companies don't exist to pay high salaries to SWE (or any other role).  Companies will only pay high salaries when they can earn even higher profits using said SWE hire. FAANG can do that. \n\nMany smaller companies, local government , don't have the scale(size of business) to multiply to a higher profit so they pay SWE based on how much company earns.; They think programmer productivity is a scam, so they go for the cheapest SWEs they can find. They also have a business that doesn't depend on the latest software, best engineering practices, etc.; Uhh.. there's a whole team who agreed to those salaries.; Simply because they're not targeting the best talent, or even average talent.; Why would you expect them to care?

They negotiate on an hourly rate and have no bargaining power because they are so small. They take what they can get. So no one in this whole operation is making money but it's a better choice for the owner than trying to find a W2 job so they keep doing it and churning juniors.; Lore? There's no lore.

   "Top Comments": ">my question is, how do i approach this and get the most out of it so i can feel way more confident going into my next interview?\n\nYou just do your best. All there is to it.\n\nTech screens are SOOO hit and miss. Sometimes you get a question that you straight up know the answer to, and still fail. Sometimes you get a ridiculously hard LC problem and think you failed and you actually pass the round. Almost all the time, it's weird bullshit that has nothing to do with the actual job.\n\nIt's a game. It's all it is. A couple of people playing their parts for an hour and then fucking off the zoom chat. Pass or fail, you'll look back and realize how fucking silly that shit was, no matter the jitters or nerves that may naturally befall us when we're in the moment.\n\nReally the only tip is, if you get stuck, just verbalize your thought process. Just talk and give what you think should be done. Give your proctors as much info as they can to help them make sure you're a smart person.\n\n> I know it sound pessimistic to say oh I've already accepted i cant pass this one \n\nIt's honestly not a bad strategy.\n\nHere's two videos that might help the point I'm about to raise (and helps me when I gotta interview)\n\n1. [This famous scene in Band of Brothers](https://youtu.be/O5YpUsDsHmk?t=27)\n2. [UFC Champion Jon Jones talking about potentially losing to Francis Ngannou](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sFi5PmDrDdA)\n\n*~~^(I hate war movies and Jon Jones btw but point aside...)~~*\n\nBoth of these basically elucidate a point I kinda take into any interview I have now: **Get comfortable with the worse case scenario** and assume you've already failed. Think about what's the worst that can happen, which is looking like a dumbass, and failing miserably on a for loop problem and losing the opportunity. Replay that over and over again. Once you get comfortable with that, you can walk in there not with a defeatist attitude, but with a detached confidence that you're just gonna go there and give your best, and if it doesn't work out, whatever.\n\nThe other thing that might help you out is that the tech leads that you'll be interviewing with have also looked like dumbasses in interviews as well. They've failed tech screens. Hell even behavioral screens. If they interviewed right now with another company they more-like-than-not will fail (interviewing is a skill that needs to be refreshed). They're humans.\n\nLastly, get a good night's sleep. 8-9 hours. It might be tough if you got a lot of thoughts in your head but treat yourself. There's nothing more you can do at this point. Just be yourself\n\nGood luck!; Being comfortable admitting when you don’t know the answer to a question is an invaluable skill. But be sure to show genuine interest in the correct answer and try to turn it into a way to show your eagerness to always further education.; 1. Don't start coding immediately. Ask clarifying questions, possible counter examples, edges cases\n2. Break down the problem into subproblems. Focus on one subproblem at a time, and explain clearly to your interviewer what your approach is.\n3. Ask for feedback; Hey, I have extreme anxiety with technical interviews and have somehow passed the majority of them. The best advice I can give is to focus a lot on trying to be friendly, and if you flat out don't know, just admit it.\n\nSay they ask you something along the lines of \"when would you choose to use a SQL database over a NoSQL database?\"\n\nYou might know a tiny bit, like that usually NoSQL databases scale better, or are better for loosely structured or totally unstructured data, but you might not know more than that, so you say this. And then you continue, saying something along the lines of how you aren't totally sure but you'd love to get more exposure to what goes into those decisions and learn more about it.\n\nThen they ask you another question that you know *literally* nothing about. Don't bullshit and try to make some shit up. Just say you do not know. I have done this multiple times in interviews and passed. I literally said 'I have no idea'. And then I added that I haven't had a chance to work with <insert thing I know nothing about>, or it's not something I'm familiar with, but I'd be happy to learn.\n\nUnless they are hiring a senior, they are usually going to be hiring for fit, reasonable competency, and someone who seems likeable. You can generally teach people technical skills. You cannot teach someone to be personable, friendly, or responsive to feedback nearly as easily, if at all; What you are asking about is more of a mental state of mind than something you can practice for a meeting.\n\nI always approached high-stress situations like this with an understanding that, I'm there for a purpose and worrying about it is would be detrimental for that purpose.   \nSo why bother.; If this is your first, you will learn a lot. You will learn what your knowledge gaps are and what you have to learn. For my interviews I actually used ChatGPT a lot to refresh myself on regular concepts. Of course take it with a grain of salt, but it's like a Google that can take more clarifying questions and give examples. I also find it useful to ask ChatGPT to give you some technical questions that match the job description. They're not all encompassing but they help you get a start until you gain more interview experience and until you find some crazy Google Doc or website with a list of questions you need (they are rare but exist).

Fortunately, all that stuff is rare these days, but it occasionally does happen.; Depends on the company and the industry, I guess. Some places are super paranoid about it, so they make you sign one. But others are more chill, especially if you're not in a super competitive field. Always read the fine print, though!

If the non-compete is to stay in power after employment ends, you must be compensated with no less than 25% of your salary.\n\nMy personal experience is that an employment contract will pretty much always include a non-compete clause, but only in the \"while contract is in power\" form, as that way it doesn't cost the company anything.; https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes; [removed]; lol.

Or they’re from people who don’t have a relevant background at all and heard one thing somewhere and are just repeating it as if they know the truth. In my experience, there are too many people from both categories.\n\nAlthough if you want to go into a research/niche-specific career ladder then I retract my statement.; No, unless you don’t pay for the degree. Georgia Tech has a well-known and cheap enough online non-thesis MS that you could justify out of intellectual curiosity. So, I mean, do it if that’s the case. Worse hobbies to have than liking CS.\n\n90% of SWE jobs don’t give a crap about an MS. The BS is enough. I have a BS in engineering and that was enough.

That’s justified for sure.; From my experience, if you're not going for an AI/ML position, most companies wont care that you have a masters; Get a masters if the industry you are targeting requires it(E.g. Fed Govt). For private sector, an MS isn't going to make you stand out much unless it is really niche(e.g. AI/ML 10 years ago).  \nGeneral comp/sci - don't waste your own money. I'm a Sr Eng leader for a top Cyber compay(30+ years in the industry and still push code to production). Having an MS may get your resume sent to me from recruiting, but how you handle the interview has 10x more weight than that MS.; I don't understand the sub's sentiment. If the Masters teaches core CS and SWE concepts, how will it not help the person. Is the said person magically supposed to know all the concepts ? Self teaching is an option, but nothing like taking a year or two out of your schedule and dedicate to learning something relevant. Doing the degree will only aid the learning and not inhibit it. With the plethora of poor tech professionals in this industry without relevant education only highlights the necessity of formal education. I am not saying formal education will make you a rockstar, it would not but it would lay down the foundation and increase the possibility of future success when some other conditions are also met (getting a SWE job versus non tech job, continuing to learn on the job etc).; I did OMSCS.

At least that's my intuition, maybe I'm wrong.\n\n>No unless you don't pay for the degree\n\nYeah I forgot to mention I'm in Canada so the degree is really cheap. Cost is not an issue thankfully.; So in short MS will help getting interviews. Also not doing an MS will not make them better in the interviews.; Oh cool, I'm thinking about doing it. Some of the finer CS points I'd like to learn from a PhD. What I'd spend on any other hobby in a year.; That's fair. I'm open to the possibly of sentiments changing when HR gets 100 applicants in the first 12 hours. Already filtering by degree, not crazy to filter for MS. You stand out a little more.\n\nAhh cheap degrees in Canada. I didn't know. I graduated on the verge of American degrees not being stupidly expensive.

This is being offset in the employment numbers by strong blue collar and service jobs hiring. It's easy to get a job washing dishes, waiting tables or building widgets for $20/hr in most areas.; I was at my brother's college of engineering graduation ceremony and it was wild to watch. Maybe 40% of the bachelors degrees that crossed the stage were computer science majors, and that's across ALL the engineering majors they had.; Can you give examples of other carrer subs that are going through the same?; Everything is cyclical, in 10 years there will be too many people in trades and not enough in white collar (this is what happened during the 2008 recession).; Going onto the skill trades subreddit, it sounds like even the trades isn't a great choice right now.

Means more room for the rest of us.; Regardless if we are talking about CS or another field of study, part of the problem is that everyone these days wants a degree but the overall supply of jobs is lower than the overall demand, hence a lot of new grads are left jobless. I am not saying this to discourage anyone from getting a degree, but to point out a fundamental issue.\n\nBack in the 1980s, the U.S. census bureau reported that apparently only 20% of people had earned a bachelor's degree or higher. (Look up \"educational attainment 1980\".) There seemed to be a greater supply of bachelor-level jobs than people getting a degree.\n\nCurrently, this educational attainment number has risen to 35% as of 2018. I can only imagine this number is higher now. I don't want to give a definitive answer, but I would not be surprised if it is at least 40% now.\n\nSo basically, the number of people getting bachelor's degrees and above has doubled in the last 40 years, but has the number of white collar jobs requiring a degree _actually_ doubled since then?\n\nThen we have to take into account the current market state.

Its a good foot in the door if you can't find a proper SWE job and would be counted as experience even if not entirely appropriate experience.; Yes, absolutely take it.  Especially because you’ll be working with Java and using automation tools.  Bonus if you can create the framework from scratch, as it entails development work.  I would’ve said no if it was a manual testing position, but yours seems more like  an SDET position.  \n\nYou can ask for read only access to the source code that you’ll be testing, and if you work closely with development, you can show them that you can understand and write the code if needed.  It’ll give you good visibility to other teams so that in the event an SWE position opens up, you can apply internally.\n\nThat was the route I took.  I had the comp sci background from college already so I knew how to code.  In my last company, we had a few QA folks get promoted to a SWE.  We also had a really competent SDET contractor come in and he was also doing dev work.  His pay was the same as our SDE’s.; I'm in your situation a year forward. I accepted that exact kind of role and am currently almost a year into it. The pro is frankly having an income and having some tangential level of coding in your day to day job. \n\nThe con is that talking to people in more development focused fields, there work is simply put better on a resume for someone who wants to focus on development. It also just seems more fun. I work next to an automation dev who I swear legitimately falls asleep in his desk as his tests are running. \n\nAll in all I still am happy I went with the job as there is some coding involvement, but It is something where it'll be up to you to find a way into straight development. If you stay lax and don't upskill and push to find a better position I can definitely see being siloed into this role.; If you don’t want the QA job can I have it?; Literally in the same boat. I have another swe offer but that pays 80k while this pays 120k. Idk what to do; Even QA is finding it extremely difficult to find jobs in this market. Companies are being extra picky for any tech role it seems, unfortunately.; If you have bills to pay you'll need something at some point. It is not really a direct or common path to doing development but you don't have to be stuck. You will likely need to keep looking to get actual development work. Don't really relay on promises from a current employer or during interviews.\n\n\n\nDoing automated QA will probably be more relevant then manual. QA in general might just be a little more relevant then something else. I don't think many employers would find the experience all that relevant to development but you could talk about working with a team or development process. After your first software role you could remove the QA role. And even if you get hired in QA you could leave that off if plan to keep looking. If you do that role for a good while maybe it's better to have it then a long gap after university.; I started in QA automation and was able to transition to a .net role in 2021. That period actual has hurt my current job hunt as boomers and gen x managers think that doesn’t count as real experience and I got shit on hard in my last stage interview. 7th round just a meet your manager and he was angry that I made it to that point and said I lied about having 6 years experience and said you are barely more than junior dev.; no; > would I be lumped in with QA and would it be tough to transition out to a regular SWE job later?\n\nyes; I had a counter experience.  In my last company, a few QA folks got promoted to SWE’s.  It’s easier to be considered for a position internally since people would be familiar with your work.; Would you say it would be better than no job at all? Or would i be better off working on projects and just aiming for a SWE job? Considering the current market.; Thats what Im hoping for. That it will give me some experience and out of me just being stuck doing projects alone and get real experience. I want to transition into a SWE but im also worried about getting stuck, since from what I’ve read on this sub is a lot of QA people are people who want to be devs but get stuck in QA. Its kind of a rock and a hard place because i want to start work but i also want to be learning how to be a dev so i can grow into a mid-senior dev down the line.; damn that's fucked up did the manager not read your resume lmao; Use QA jobs as a last resort if you are unable to get any SWE jobs at all, and work on proactively developing your SWE skills if you have to work as QA. I also had a difficult time making the jump to SWE, it's like playing the game on ultra hard mode while everyone else is playing normal difficulty.; I'd take it with a grain of salt.  I've interviewed QA staff wanting to transition into engineering and some are just as good as our SWE staff and others are utterly incompetent at coding.  I think a lot of former CS grads who are in the latter bucket enter QA and then wonder why they can't become SWE simply because they lack the necessary skills.; I doubt it cause the interview essentially went like this. \n\n“This is just a get to know you interview for the both of us. Tell me about your 1st job”\n\n“Well I started in QA Automation but I didn’t really write tests I mainly focused on building and maintaining the automation framework.”\n\n“Why did you leave it after two years?”\n\n“Well I wasn’t seeing upward mobility and was being pushed into a less technical role”\n\n\n“Let me stop you there I meant why didn’t you leave sooner being in that job was a waste of time if you wanted to be a dev. I don’t think your career started until 2021.” \n\nHe also asked me to rate myself on a scale of 1-10 for my skills as a dev and when I said 7 as I have areas I have a lack of experience like front end and non cloud based SQL he said I think you’re more like a 3. Maybe a 3.5.; Say I’m fortunate enough to be offered the position and take it, in your opinion what are some SWE skills that I should be working on in order to make that jump from QA to SWE?"

   "Top Comments": "It can help you succeed in any industry, that’s human nature, but can you succeed without it, absolutely. I wouldn’t worry about it, as long as you don’t smell and practice basic hygiene you’ll be fine.; Personal grooming *is* a soft skill. You don't need to be hot but you do need to look like you can take care of yourself.; It's important to the extent that people don't want to work with dirty slobs.   Maybe less of an issue with remote work, but when working in the office you want your co-workers to be clean looking.  You don't want to be the stinky guy that looks like a homeless person.\n\nGenerally speaking there is probably a level of career where appearances are somewhat important.  This is probably not a level most people will reach, but I'm talking VP and C-Level type jobs.  Dressing in a well fitting suit and having a confident appearance will take you a long way. \n\nThere was a movie called \"Catch Me If You Can\", where it demonstrates how somebody that dresses the part and acts confidently can go a long way before being caught.  Obviously this is a movie, but the idea holds.  Back in the 90's I snuck back stage at big concerts just by acting like I belonged and knowing when to make a move.; Humans are shallow and so you want to leverage as much privilege as you can to get as much as you can because greed is the game.; You dont have to be a roided out bodybuilder but it's good life and health practice in general to be active and maintain your physical fitness. \n\nI'm a DS, not a SWE, but we both spend 8+ hours a day everyday on our asses, being immobile and barely moving. \n\nBut in any industry, being fit, dressing work appropriate, and being confident will get you far. \n\nFunnily enough, when I played magic the gathering tournaments, I used to play with a few older dudes with long salt and pepper beards, a slight beer belly, cargo shorts, and Jesus sandals who were all programming gurus; Whatever shirts you got for free at the last conference, socks with crocs, jeans maybe even sweatpants. Believe it or not, that’s what peak performance looks like; In any industry you want to work, yes, humans tend to prefer opening their door to people who don't look like fucking beggars.; Eh, I've seen senior engineers in hoodies be successful. I've also been in meetings where the business folks look down on engineering because they don't dress like a business person in an office. My mentality is, there are a lot of people who will have all kinds of silly reasons to brush me off and the things I say. I want to do everything in my power to minimize that list. So I dress up. If I'm not going to be successful it's going to be because my skill set sucks. Not because some higher up thought I'm not promotable because I don't present myself properly.; Being alive is more important I suppose; >Is being fit\nNo\n\n>good looking\nNo\n\n>and well dressed\nDepends on your definition of well-dressed. I think that dressing appropriately for the job and audience is important.\n\nI work from home, and if I'm meeting with my team, I'm just wearing a decent T-shirt. If I'm meeting with my boss even -tshirt. But if I'm meeting with someone at my boss' level - or my boss' boss? Im at least putting on a polo.\n\nIt's not about putting on a full suit in an office where no one does, but wearing clean, well fitting, appropriately clothing is going to be seen as a sign of respect - whole not doing it will convey the opposite.; Less important than most jobs I expect.\n\nBeing presentable is important, but it's probably less important as a software developer than it is for being a banker for example, or lawyer, or doctor.; Technically not necessary, but beneficial in my experience; Good looks always help your career, but it helps less in this industry than others (as in every career focused on human interaction, e.g. lawyers, BDs).; The only way that could ever hurt is if someone with power or influence takes umbrage (through something like jealousy or cultural discomfit) or you have to do something offensive to your upright sensibilities to bring it about.; A minimum of hygiene is always appreciated. Also, please keep your keyboard clean if you’re working on an office.; Being clean and well presented won't necessarily propel you forward, but being smelly and looking like you don't care absolutely can hold you back.  Personal hygiene in particular is something that entirely should hold people back, offices are communal spaces and nobody wants to promote BO dude.\n\nClassically good looking people do better in every industry, that's just humans being humans. I'm convinced that 80% of being good looking is actually just being fit and having a good haircut, so yes being fit would be included in that too.\n\nSide-note: Being physically fit (healthy, not necessarily jacked) also gives people a bunch more energy and embeds habits of discipline, so it could just make people better at their jobs, too.; I think you are okay if you have a shower at least ones every two days, if you go to the Office. If you wfh nobody will care.; It’s ok to smell as long as you are also a nerd and refuse to publish exe files; The Richard Stallman effect; I have absolutely no problem with people dressing casual (especially to sit at a desk all day) but the moment they're not clean it's a big problem.  My office had to put up signs pre-covid reminding men to shower before coming into work ."

Anyhow this company just looks like another clone of them. I can’t really think of how you would verify any of these companies tho.  Reading your post I don’t see any evidence you found a scam.

   "Title": "What’s it like working at Amazon now days?",
   "Top Comments": "I've been at Amazon for over 10 years and really only worked at a couple startups in college. So take that for what that is. (TL;DR it's a minefield)\n\nI've worked at multiple teams in AWS and retail and the company has definitely changed a lot in the last 10 years. I think the \"startup culture\" that was already pretty much dead when I joined has been exhumed and desecrated enough times that I don't even think there is any unique culture to speak of.\n\nReally what you see here now is sort of weird islands of other company's cultures stood up as bastions within the larger company. Some teams have leadership that wants to run their ship like a Microsoft (mostly Azure/AI) shop. That's the most common sort of enclave you'll run into here. But you'll also see weird meta islands where ex-AWS or Alexa leaders will spin up a team in retail (AWS and Alexa have historically operated differently than retail).\n\nSurprisingly to some, the most soul-crushing time I had was in AWS. It was a brand new service even, but the whole thing was just a bad idea. Nobody other than government agencies who wanted to check a compliance box would have wanted to use it. The whole product seemed to have been conceived to help promote a principal engineer but the worst part was that once an AWS service is made it's very difficult to shut down (particularly because we did manage to get a government agency to use it and I feel so bad they are forced to use such a half-baked product). Luckily the org did realize the mistake and made a couple better products learning from it, but there is literally a skeleton crew having to waste their career potential manning a virtually dead service. I definitely wasted a year there being strung along by poor leadership. \n\nGiven my tenure and connections I've secured myself a very comfortable position where I now basically work on whatever I want while providing technical guidance to a bunch of senior SDEs. I know for a fact not everyone is that lucky and I'd recommend only joining Amazon if you know with high confidence that there are good career progression opportunities (or low-stress coasting if that's what you're into). It really helps to know/trust the senior leaders in the org you're joining but barring that, having contacts that work there who can attest to their experience there. Don't go in blind.; As a former AWS SDE, it is super team and org dependent. The culture is quite variable between teams. There are also many teams with 1-2 pages a week, as well as 30 a week. \n\nIf you can, try to verify with some engineers and managers about the ops load, scope, and tech stack (if you hear LPT run away asap)\n\nI personally didn't have a good experience, but I know many engineers who have.; There are good teams and bad teams and everywhere in between. \n\n\nLayoffs affected Amazon just like everywhere else - but perhaps more so. We are all very aware that the company doesn't even pretend to give a shit about our wellbeing. \n\n\nThere is a lot of short term thinking, fearfulness, and ass-covering. Roadmaps are fucked, and everyone is understaffed. As an IC this translates to being on the hook for even more. \n\n\nPay has flatlined (depending on how you view RSUs) and folks want out - but realistically, where are we going to go? \n\n\nIf you're the type of person who is ok with obeying product at any cost (tech debt? never heard of her!) and don't mind trampling anyone around you to prove yourself to them, you'll do well in the current climate. ; I don't work there, but it every hard to get a sense of work culture and environment at big companies. People on good teams don't post about there experience and people in bad ones can't wait to post.; A friend of mine lasted 6 months and almost had a nervous breakdown, or did. I forget which. Abusive would be a good word. On call for bullshit.; It really depends heavily on the org and team.  I I started at Amazon in fall of 2022 as an SDE3.  My org is pretty chill and it’s been head and shoulders better than the startup I was working at prior.  My workload is lower, stress is lower, and the pay and benefits are worlds better.  We also haven’t been hit by any layoffs.\n\nI am well aware that my experience does not track with the “normal” Amazon experience, but I for one have been super happy to be working here.; Join and team hop till you feel like you’re somewhere you like. Don’t stay for friendly coworkers. Make sure you join a team that has a PM or product guy if not you will be doing 3 peoples jobs. When picking teams see how much documentation they have. Most teams will have 0 docs other than crappy overly long LLD and HLD’s. Join AWS. before aws was known to be the crazy busy place and everywhere else was chill. Now all the other orgs have been gutted and everyone is extremely busy but they don’t have the organization or talent of AWS.; 15 years at Amazon, more than half in AWS. 10 years at Microsoft, and 5 plus in small companies going back into the 80s while in high school. I've seen it all at this point.\n\nThe answer to your question is it depends. On the team as others have pointed out, but also on what you want from the relationship. \n\nThe perfect software company is a myth. They all suck for one reason or another. Crunch, politics, etc. come from human nature when driven by capitalism while working on something with intangible value and an unpredictable nature. You will find the same everywhere. So go where you go with your eyes open.\n\nIf you're looking to learn how to build and operate world class distributed systems because you think they are fascinating, then Amazon is a good option. If you want to learn how software is created at scale, the real sausage making with all the good and bad, then it can be a good choice. What you learn is the value you get for your pain and only you can decide if it is worth it.\n\nIf you want to write beautifully crafted code while taking your time to enjoy other parts of your life.... Good luck with making much money but find a nice niche kind customer you can work for as a consultant. That's the least painful option if you can find the right clients.; Its a very top down shit culture.  Since the layoffs started its been really tense.\n\nThere is one skill you definitely pick up here and that is self sufficiency.  There isn't much help and you are thrown into projects/problems constantly that you have little to no context on and are quickly needed to find paths forward.\n\nAmazon pays really well, its a good resume stamp and great work experience early on in your career.  \n\nThis is if you get decent managers, if you get stuck with a bad one then its hell and useless from the get go.  \n\nAWS is definitely more engineering driven in general than retail, less PMs and other job descriptions to deal with.\n\nAs an IC, you will design, deliver and be responsible for systems at scale, its definitely good experience if you tend to use native AWS technologies.  A lot of senior + principle level engineers are very good.; Completely depends on team and org.; Super org dependent. I am finding it pretty chill in terms of wlb and stress. Definitely better than I expected when reading stuff on the internet. But culture is pretty corporate; Been on AWS for a year. Working on a new project here and it’s been … something. Just a single micromanaging senior/manager who happens to be a “know it all”, while also being a 24/7 workaholic is enough to fuck up the entire team culture. Which I didn’t know was possible given I like 95% of people on my team/org. \n\nAlso everyone is an H1B which means more exploitation and they won’t say no to literally anything. Which creates a feedback loop of people working working working and before you know it you’re “forced” into being online responding to messages and issues at 9pm. If you’re a citizen of the US, don’t put up with that bullshit. The fact I don’t give a shit about my product doesn’t help either.\n\nI’d advise to proceed with caution and really get to know the team you’re joining. Worse case you can team switch after working here for a bit, but I think many get past the point of no return. Always have an exit strategy in mind and don’t get fucked in the process. That being said the tech stack I was working with has opened many doors for some external interviews so at least I’m grateful for that. Good luck.; My experience at Amazon has been very positive. It’s mostly the fact that people who have good or neutral experiences don’t really complain, that gives it a bad rep.\n\nAnd Amazon has about 300k corporate employees, makes it really easy to find people with bad experience(which tbf a lot of them exist).\n\nWorking here has made me insanely independent, very comfortable and efficient at picking up new stuff fast. I’ve learned so much, especially at scale. Not a lot of companies where you can see your code deploy to hundreds of thousands of servers in a single deployment. Great learning experience, good WLB too!\n\nPay raises every year has been really good too for me, stock yearly refreshers and a decent base pay increase, but it’s been out pacing inflation by double digits.\n\nIBM doesn’t innovate anymore, but IMO Amazon still have products which innovate, which is the biggest difference between the two companies in my eyes.; Last time I heard of a SWE working at Amazon, it was them exposing a HR saying how they actually view workers as less than huamn\n\nSo I'll be avoiding them for now; You get fired in 6 months; It is team/org specific. I have friends working there as sde ii, and feedbacks I heard weren't so good. A lot of office politics, credit stealings, and scapegoatings. It seems managers don't give the slightest damm about the well-being of their subordinates. One of my friends is taking fmla now. However, people with bad experience tend to be louder. Personally, I will consider Amazon only if I'm miserable in my current role or if they offer me a very enticing package.; It is team or organization specific, but a common issue I've seen is the culture is to actively not help others.  You want help with this app I wrote?  Figure it out yourself!  In many parts it's about pushing as many people down below you to ensure you are not on the pip pile.\n\nAnd their leadership principles is treated like gospel in some areas.  You'll notice helping others is not one of them.; My team is extremely chill, 9-5 work at AWS; I'm hitting 3 years at Amazon this week, I joined as a new grad so I don't have anything to compare it to, but so far I've really enjoyed my time. Like everyone says it is very team dependent. I am lucky that I work with a great manager and some really smart SDEs so I've been learning a lot. \n\nIn my 3 years only 1 person has been pip'd and tbh they deserved it, my manager gave him a long leash too, but he basically contributed nothing for like 18 months.\n\nFor my friends who joined Amazon, it's been a mixed bag. Some joined good teams and still like it. Some joined good teams that turned bad during the layoffs, and some joined bad teams from the start and have already moved teams and seem to be doing better now.; Pretty chill ngl"

   "Top Comments": "Slim-to-none. H-1Bs are a lottery and companies generally aren't willing to invest that much time and money into a non-deterministic process, particularly for entry level candidates who are far more fungible. The typical path to the US is by doing a degree there, which grants you limited work authorization, or through and internal transfer. Canada is probably going to be more likely than the US.; German? your most likely path is probably either H1B or L1 visa, or I guess if you're willing to wait for Canadian citizenship that also opens up TN1 \n  \nsomething you need to understand is\n  \n\\#1 US doesn't have 1 work visa there's like 10 different work visas\n  \n\\#2 don't think US as 1 country, think like ~50 country smashed into 1, each state has its own laws and each city does its own thing, it takes like 5h non-stop flight from coast to coast (more if you include Alaska or Hawaii) so you need to be specific to exact city: what's normal/true in CA-San Francisco on how companies operate, interview process, local cultural norm, tech scene... may be totally false in, say, CA-San Diego; AI/ML is the hottest subfield on the market now.  There were never many entry level jobs to begin with, and now everyone's trying to get in.  Competitive candidates have PhDs or MS + years of legit work experience as an engineer or DS.  Having student experience makes you a better applicant but it does not vault you out of the \"entry level\" pool.   \n\nThrow in visa sponsorship on top?  I don't like your chances, fam.\n\nIf you don't want to do more education in the US (can only speak for US) then internal transfer or marrying a citizen are your only options, really.; Funny, my old employer obliterated engineering in the USA and moved all AI ML work to Germany and Poland... I still see tons of jobs posted in both locations, while my old place went from thousands of engineers to hundreds to dozens. \n\nI'm European born myself btw.; Small bit of trivia about the H-1B is there are two lottery pools, one for undergrad and one for postgrad, with the latter having slightly better chances.\n\n\nIf you're going for the H-1B, you'll want to leverage the topic of your masters to aim for higher than junior level roles. My brother got into Duolingo this way using a PhD in computational linguistics (though that was well over a decade ago)\n\n\nL-1 transfer is another option if your current employer has north american presence and has some business rationale for having you over on this side of the pond, e.g. minimizing timezone friction within a team. Caveat is in current environment, employers are more keen on offshoring to Europe to cut costs, than the other way around.\n\n\nO-1 is another option if you have academic  publications with some level of notoriety in the industry.\n\n\nMy path was a canadian permanent residence into citizenship into TN visa. The fastest you can \"speedrun\" this path into US is around 5 years due to residence requirements and processing times, though obtaining the initial work visa has become more challenging in recent years. It does however open the path to triple citizenship; If i may speak freely... I spent two decades collaborating with German, Swedish, Polish, and the occasional French engineer. High stakes embedded, Linux or QNX, 100-200 people teams, not simple center div stuff.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was their adherence to real engineering and science principles. I was lead UX and produced standards and documentation that was kindergarten level compared to my German colleagues. Mostly because management had my team understaffed to oblivion and wanted everything done yesterday. \n\nMy colleagues had MS and the occasional PhD like we did. But their work quality was better than ours. Quantity though... When the shit hit the fan we could be counted upon to deliver MacGyver stuff which my colleagues would not do. They had very formal processes, that were incredibly helpful but time consuming. Difference in attitudes.\n\nIn terms of technology, companies like Elektrobit or Bosch or Siemens or what have you were awesome. Very good people. The only catch - some rigidity and lower pay. Not by a lot back then, but now it's hugely different. \n\nStill i would think hard about coming to the USA. Money is better and more options, definitely. But after four decades here i think I'm ready to call it a career. On se voit à Marseille 😎; I see, thanks for the insight! I'm definitely done with academia after this degree so if nothing else works out, I'm betting on an internal opportunity. Thankfully my current employer is based primarily in NA so once I've settled in full-time, I should be able to make a request eventually. I'm just hoping not to have to wait until the end of my 20s to move.; I think H1B is plan A, that's what I'm hoping to find a company that'd support that process. Haven't thought about the TN1 option, not ruling that out though - thanks!\n\nMy mentality regarding an entry job is really to be open to pretty much any place, just to get a good start wherever I can. Long-term though, if I got to pick, SoCal (particularly L.A.) would be the top choice.; Yeah that's what I figured - gonna place my bets on my current employer which is already a dream job in itself. Just hoping it won't take another five years of compromising on where I want to live.; Really? Seems surprising considering there should be way more qualified candidates in the U.S. than here; I still find myself having to explain the field to many people I meet here in Germany. I guess the lower tech salaries in Europe play a part in it?; This is such valuable information, thank you! Had no idea about the two lottery pools, I'll definitely be looking into the latter. I'm thankfully writing my master's thesis in co-op with my employer (large CAN-based IT corp) and the topic is very industry-relevant, so that could come in handy. \n\nI think L-1 could be a realistic option but I suppose I'll have to spend some time working full-time here in my German team before I can move to request that transfer. \n\nTriple citizenship sounds like the absolute dream, although I'd be more than happy to obtain double one day. Do you mind me asking how long the process of obtaining the Canadian PR card was for you?; Thanks for your insights!  \n  \nCan confirm the adherence to standard practices and the emphasis placed on documentation by most people here (in which I 100% see the value but sometimes struggle with when I simply wanting to keep coding). \n\nI will likely be looking at some PhD options but have always felt that a MS + hands-on work experience is the best path when it comes to working in the industry. Pretty much what you said: when it comes down to it, efficiency > formality. When a prototype is due in short time span, the important thing is to get it up and running. Documentation etc. can always be added later on. \n\nBosch in particular is a hugely popular employer where I'm from, apparently great working conditions and fair compensation. Can't speak for the others but probably similar. For me personally though, I'm happy to have found a NA-based employer since the work culture is a lot more laid back and, particularly in my part of the country, pays much better than other companies.  \n  \nMy priority has always been to feel more culturally at home, which I do in the U.S. more so than here. In terms of money and career, I'm more than happy with a job that offers long-term financial stability and a solid work-life balance. \n\nWell, bienvenue à l'Europe and enjoy the sweet life in the south of France! Hoping to take advantage of remote work and spend a month in the area towards the end of this year as well.; >My mentality regarding an entry job is really to be open to pretty much any place, just to get a good start wherever I can\n  \nyou kind of got this reversed\n  \nI know what you're thinking: \"me as a foreigner would any company please please take me? I'm not picky\"\n  \nwhen in reality, you stand far higher chance of being in the 3 US tech hubs which is San Francisco, Seattle, or NYC, because companies in those 3 cities have the highest probability of not minding doing USCIS immigration paperworks for you (think: some small town in Texas you tell them they need to bring in immigration lawyers they'd just laugh and pick a local)\n  \nthe detail of course is those 3 are also the most competitive places to get a job since they recruit world-wide (you're not the only person in the world looking for jobs in those 3 cities), expect fierce competition on the scale of easily thousands, 10s of thousands, if not 100s of thousands of other candidates/resumes to compete against\n  \nin other words think this way: why would any US company hire you, a foreigner, when there's countless US locals to pick who don't have visa issues? the answer is you must beat out all of them: out of all the candidates the company interviewed YOU are the one they want and they think it's worth the trouble relocating you + doing immigration paperworks for you; [removed]; Company used to be US based and managed with subsidiaries everywhere. Then US labor force shrunk big time, while growing India Poland and China.

The PR card came out about a year after I applied.\n\n\nThat's enough to enjoy most of the same benefits as a canadian citizen, except the passport, voting rights and importantly TN visa eligibility (aka, no lottery)\n\n\nCitizenship requirements are also fairly easy, with the most \"onerous\" being the 3 year canadian residence requirement.\n\n\nI currently hold a US green card, whose requirements are comparatively more annoying to obtain (employer sponsorship of H-1B or similar dual intent visa, labor certification, biometrics, medical exam, etc) and maintain (6 months US residence per year).\n\n\nUS citizenship has a 5 year residence requirement, and the US has a somewhat unique tax policy on foreign income (though in practice that's not a problem for countries w/ tax treaties); Well you got me there, thanks for debunking that haha. That makes total sense, and actually aligns with what I'm hoping to get (started my first corporate job a while ago and would pick that environment over smaller companies any day). \n\nYeah the competition is easy to forget about when you see job postings that almost perfectly match your profile, but there are so many other people with the same profile and maybe more YOE seeking those jobs as well.

   "Title": "Is all of tech oversaturated?",
   "Top Comments": "Cybersecurity and data analysis roles are even more saturated, because everyone saw them as an easy way to “break into tech” during the bubble.; _All?_ No. Most? Yes.\n\nGenerally speaking, entry-level (BS/MS) is oversaturated as others have said, but emerging fields/areas are always popping up, and because they are new, they actually have a high demand but low supply at this moment. But that might be stating the obvious. :)\n\nIt really boils down to what specific/niche area you want to go into. It can be a bit tricky though because some technologies are trendy _now_ but may quickly lose steam.\n\nAnyway, from what I have seen, almost all emerging tech (outside of ML/AI) relates to the cloud in some way, and _those_ jobs tend to have higher demand than others. I am not saying the competition for those jobs _isn't_ fierce, but it may be _less_ fierce.; Speaking for the US market, it depends a lot on where you're looking.\n\nJobs in tech hub cities at tech companies are rather saturated other than a few high skilled niches.\n\nOnce you get outside that bubble, there are more jobs. The hitch is that they may be in less desirable locations with a lower salary, less interesting/challenging work and fewer fringe benefits. For example, they may be offering in the $75k range, require 5 days a week in the office, and working on a legacy web or desktop app with a horrible codebase.; Those other tech jobs are too close to SWE jobs to not be affected.  It’s mostly the same or related budgets, products, issues, etc.  They’ll move in tandem, not go sharply in different directions.; Why are there so many cybersecurity bootcamps? I dont think I have ever seen a single entry level cybersecurity role. Same with AI bootcamps.; I don't get where did this cybersecurity is easy/easier to break in come from, if anything cybersecurity would require even higher hiring bar because #1 it's mostly a luxury for companies #2 Bachelor's degree really don't teach you enough you probably need either a Master's or PhD and #3 you fucking up can have far more serious consequences than a SWE fuck up; The only thing that isn’t is TS/SCI jobs \n\nMost of you won’t qualify; I hear there’s incredibly high demand for AI folks with multiple high impact publications. \n\nI think semiconductor engineering jobs are hot right now too. \n\nOverall, seems like low barrier to entry jobs are tough. At least engineers are better off than scrum masters these days; Firmware and software engineering in the med device field sends fine.  At least in MN. You can't have a \"move fast and break things\" attitude though.  A focus on safety key.; I’d say all entry level is over saturated, may be except for positions that requires PhD.; People are gonna hate me saying this but the least saturated sector is full stack development. Most companies now would rather hire a full stack dev than a backed dev, and while only some companies are big enough for backend exclusive or front end exclusive devs, everyone needs full stack. The same is true for other job titles like data analyst, cybersecurity, software architect. Those jobs are only in demand at certain companies, but again every company needs full stack development regardless of industry. \n\nAnd as for amount of talent, there aren’t many developers that are truly full stack devs. Usually most people are more one or the other.; There are holes on the market. For example legacy tech like Delphi or Visual Basic etc. because everyone wants to do some cool new tech. Even Ruby is not so cool anymore so the competition is not so crazy. Another field is low-code like OutSystems, Mendix, etc. because SWEs despise it like \"it is not coding\" while it is OOP+ORM coding, just visual.; Yes; It is indeed. When I finished my BS CS, ~11 years ago from a state school, I had offers starting at $65k at a major Energy management and automation company and another at $67k at a defense aerospace company. Both F500 and I chose the automation company. I was your slightly above average student hanging on to barely a 3.2 (slightly lower was my overall ). I had failed (& repeated) three classes, spent **six** years in school, did a few internships and got a nice starting salary for its time and place. My resume was far from “impressive”. \n\nNow I see kids coming out of top CS universities such as UCI, ASU, UCSB, UA , OSU with 3.5/3.6s but they can’t get hired since there is so much competition. The projects they did in school and on the side are impressive to say the least, yet they can’t find jobs, internships, etc. I was talking to my older brother and his kids are in middle school and they are developing apps in python! *In 8th grade*. My best friend’s daughter who will be going to Cal Berkeley next year for her CS degree is asking me if we have any openings for internships. Bud I didn’t even have a resume when I was a high school senior. I played some sports, barely passed out of high school with a 3.0 and that’s that. Kids are being fed that CS is the only way to make big bucks other than law or med school that’s why there’s a massive over saturation. Each year there are 100-110k CS grads if not much more, in the US. Not to mention the ability to do remote work and off shoring jobs so people in Mexico, Poland, and India can also do the jobs at fraction the rate. There are just way too many people in CS !; DE is oversaturated. If you are in college now, chances are the jobs won't be there when you graduate.; The answer too this question is no. The salaries would deflate if it was truly over saturated but this sub is doomer as hell and hates prepping for interviews. Half the comments sections say people straight up turn down interviews when companies send them a hacker rank or code signal challange.; Late to the party but I’m 10 years into my career. What I’ve noticed is that a lot of the desirable early career jobs are offers that go out to interns in swe first. \n\nIf you do a 4 year degree with no internships, no projects to show for it, or no published research you’re going to have a bad time. \n\nComp Sci + X, where X is something else you’re interested in (maybe something you can minor in) also opens early doors because of the combination of things.\n\nI currently work at a company that’s heavy into distributed systems engineering and very performance sensitive. The expectations of our interns are equivalent of that of a swe1, except they get the cool projects. \n\nAlso: the Waterloo model has their candidates in high demand. Having so many internships / work experience coming out of your 4 year let’s you have way more say in your first “job”.; So what sector is not oversaturated and we can get into with cs degrees?; Nothing would have been over saturated if it wasn’t for Indians honestly. They outsource jobs to India making a huge mistake.; Do people think asking the same questions that were asked 3+ times here every day will have a different answer?"

   "Top Comments": "How's your tolerance for being in meetings constantly while having to deal with corporate administrivia, like HR? This will be a huge part of your job in management in most organizations. It's why I went back to being an IC after doing management for a while. \n\nBeyond that, it requires some people skills to be successful at it, including how to motivate people. Have you ever done anything like this? Some people call managing engineers of any type \"herding cats\" and it can be like that. It may also include firing and laying off people. This can be emotionally draining for many people.\n\nIf your company has a clear career path to management roles, that would probably be easiest for you. Not all companies do this though. When I went into management, I had to switch companies. I had to switch again to go back to being an IC.; It's a tough call. Companies want less management recently especially with Meta's flattening permeating the industry. Front line engineering managers are always needed but even then I'm seeing things like those positions being consolidated to have 10+ directs. I've had no luck in applying to engineering management jobs over the past year even while having management duties. Individual coder roles seem to be easier to find. However, it's completely up to you based on your personal passions. I love coding but I'm too much of a hacker; I write sloppy but clever code. I can't compete toe to toe with others, so I figured I have better skills leading others and saying what should be built.; Its probably easier to switch at your current place.  From what I've seen and interviewed management is a chicken-egg problem.  Where they really only want to hire people with management experience.  If you can get a year or two on your resume then you're probably good to go elsewhere.  Unfortunately I've also seen people get shoe horned into management simply because they've done it before.; It’s easier to get into management in your current company than find a role externally that would take a chance on you, since they already know you and what your capabilities are. \n\nMost places I’ve worked the managers have succession plans documented with the potential people that could replace them in future. You need to get yourself onto that list. I’d start by telling your manager about your career goals and actively searching for opportunities to show your leadership qualities - lead projects, do mentoring, drive conversations in meetings, make yourself the go to problem solver. Also find yourself a mentor somewhere in your org that’s a senior leader, ideally a skip level. \n\nThen when a position comes up you’ll have plenty of examples for the interview, you’ll already be a potential leader in your managers mind and ideally have endorsement from someone at your managers manager level. \n\nThe process can take awhile though, be prepared to wait a couple of years unless you get lucky and a secondment opportunity comes up. Especially in this job climate, companies are way less likely to take a chance on someone without experience at the moment.; No one will hire you to manager level in a different company with no management experience. Unless you just got an MBA. You need to get promoted internally. You have the chance so do it. 10 YoE is a good run. You can be a better manager than someone who never coded.; What do you understand 'management' to be .. especially with respect to what you do day-to-day?; Thanks for responding. Do you mind elaborating on your last point, why is it easier to go through the switch from my current company rather than interview for management roles at other companies?; Most other companies will usually be expecting a year or more of management experience. Your company, if they offer a career growth path, will want to train you into the role, perhaps with some mentoring from an experienced manager or training classes."

If/when you win, you'll see by circumstances how is it going. You should keep on mind that:\n1. Chance of winning is really small. I know of people who tried for 10+ years with no luck\n2.

Well, if you _know_ you will need accommodations when you start the job, then you probably will have a hard time getting them if you outright say no on your application.

How about look for someone else to review your code instead?; [deleted]; Can you give an example?; Welcome to the software world. Not everyone is a mentor type and the passive aggressiveness can really hurt morale.; Idk if this constitutes bullying, unless it can be seen clearly in their language. It's not a good practice to not reply to comments, but it could be that your questions might be somewhat basic and that could be explained to you someplace other than the PR. Not explaining the reasoning is an issue and should be brought up, idk what to feel about caps lock, it's implied in a social media setting it means someone's yelling, but is it the same on GitHub? Idk.\n\nI remember when I was a newbie and wasn't following the snake case naming conventions in my codes, so all my seniors decided they'd comment in snake_case on all my PRs until I get it. Worked like a charm. Was it bullying? Nah not really.; Sometimes I would rather have a \"slap you\" button when doing code reviews. When someone keeps doing the same mistakes over and over again it really gets on your nerves. Not saying it's ok to use all caps  but I understand why someone would ignore comments. I've worked with developers who didn't want to listen and follow the style guide and just argued why their way is better. After some time you stop answering as it just drains you.; Great idea to make a written policy.  \n  \n[This ](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/)was required reading at an old job and I swear by it. It was even linked in the company's style guide and included in every repo's \"contributing.md\".; I don't know, I always explain my reasoning when requesting changes and if I can't explain it, then I'm not asking for the change. The only exception is when I expect it to be obvious/trivial to the receiving person, but that judgment call can be incorrect of course. Just ask \"Why?\" and once everything else is addressed, ask for a re-review. If they refuse to answer or are dicks about it, they're idiots and you can escalate that. Unless you really suck and are on thin ice already, then I'd just do what they say 💀; Yeah I will definitely try to select somebody else as the code reviewer.; Makes sense but I also feel kind of guilty because I feel like that person is under a lot of stress.; I agree.

They aren't necessarily trying to be rude, but they refuse to put in the effort to adapt to that new norm. It's not worth pursuing at that point and you just accept that they aren't being rude (because that's what ultimately matters) and move on.; > Sometimes I would rather have a \"slap you\" button when doing code reviews.\n\nYou need to fix that part of yourself.; [deleted]; Where I work, everyone is pretty much senior dev, so changes are either change X to Y or this might have performance or security issues, fix it yourself. And you can always send a message to a person if you think that they are wrong or not aware of something. So it real depends on PRs, but OP's coworker sounds like nightmare. But it sounds like OP doesn't need to add them as a reviewer, which in some way solves the problem. \n\nOn the second thought, that person might be doing that on purpose. This way, people are going to stop adding them as reviewer.; Yeah! That's a positive mindset!!"

Can't wait to see what debates pop up this time around!; Is it possible to be upleveled from L4 to L5 if you do amazing on the onsite?; If your recruiter thinks you have a chance at being L5, they may instruct your interviewers to submit ratings for L4 and L5 candidacy. Otherwise, probably not, no. Your work history is going to have a bigger impact on your leveling. I've conducted about 50 interviews and I've never seen this happen.; It's more about not being downleveled to L4, tbh... \n\nYou need to have at least L5 equivalent experience to be considered for L5, and like all Faangs, they'll try to downlevel if possible"

   "Top Comments": "Vast majority of people in tech industry does not have military background.\n\nMilitary service is totally different career field.  If you want to join the Army, go ahead.  Generally, it's not going to help you advance tech career.\n\nIf you want the best career prospects in the Army, look into military logistics field.  Knowing intimate details of Army procurement process will land you immediate jobs at gov contractors after Army service.; You don't need to go into the military to get a security clearance. A company can hire you and put you to work on some non-classified tasks or training while your clearance application is processed. \n\nMy son did what you are talking about, except he didn't get the job he was hoping for. The good part was he had plenty of time to take remote classes from a CC. After discharge, he transferred to a T10 CS program and went into FAANG after graduation.\n\n  \nWFH is tough to get right now, and I think its a bad idea to go right into that when you graduate. Get a feel for the corporate environment before you go on your own.; Do you want to go into the army generally? Or do you see it as a step into SWE? ; Defense contractors love veterans. They’ll pay for your clearance needed for job too.; Do it. I went in as airborne infantry for 3 years and it was the single best decision I’ve ever made. The people I’ve met, the places I’ve been to, the memories I’ve had and the values I’ve learned… immeasurable. In the moment, a lot of it was fucking awful and pure misery (usual infantry stuff), but looking back, I’m glad it all happened. \n\nYou’d think if I could go back, I would have picked a high IQ job like cyber security instead of infantry but my specific path that my choices led me on… I can’t put a value on it. The domino effect of events it put me on was priceless. I do recommend you pick either 25B or 17C though. Or really any intel/IT job. Look into the other branches too. You’ll hear this a lot, but the service really is what you make of it. \n\nI miss it but I wouldn’t go back. One and done for me. \n\nAlso, I managed to save almost $50k while I was in. Your expenses are really, really low while you’re in so long as you don’t carry any debt or have an expensive woman in your life. \n\nI am now a SRE making $190k less than 3 years after my service BTW. It looks good on a resume and sets me apart, employers genuinely assume veterans are more mature than regular 22 year old college grads with minimal life experience. It also gives you nepotism in the event your hiring manager is a vet, which is more common than you think. You won’t get hired solely because you’re a vet, but you’ll definitely get a little more preference. You will still need to be qualified for the job; Your question is whether you’ll be denied wfh opportunities because you’re a veteran? That’s a ridiculous idea, of course you’ll still be able to get wfh jobs. I’ve worked with tons of veterans over the years at big tech companies.; It'll look good on a resume.\n\nNavy or Air Force may be better.\n\nDon't be a soldier it's not worth it. Destroys your back and ruins your life. Try to work in logistics or intel.; Veteran status is a protected class. If you are denied jobs because you are a veteran you can sue. \n\nWith regards to clearance, you can get cleared through your employer without being a veteran. This is how most SWEs get clearance.; I want to go to do it for the financial stability. And gaining experience. So when I go into SWE or Hardware Eng it'll be easier for me to step into SWE. So yes; Should I go to the the Military Before or After I get my comp sci degree?; SWE isn't in the best position right now (at least to the average university/non-trad student) and being veteran status opens up doors to better universities and jobs with veteran status + that sweet GI bill. So I'd say do it, worst case scenario you had a few more years to think about what you really want to do and spend that tuition assistance on."

   "Title": "Has anyone ever heard of companies demanding projects that take more than 15 days to complete as a part of hiring process?",
   "Top Comments": "Yes, I have heard of some companies doing this, and it is always a scam.\n\nAt the end of the day, scummy companies do this to get free labor. Instead of paying someone internally to do a certain task, they prey on interviewees who don't know any better. They basically pretend the project is an \"interview task,\" when it actually isn't.\n\nThink about it this way: you are spending 15 days on a project and not getting paid for it. It is obviously a lengthy project, too. Whether you get the job or not, you will not be compensated for your time and effort on this project. Meanwhile, they may take your work and use it internally and you may have no idea.; Yeah fuck that; I don’t do any take home project.   \nOnline leetcode assessment + 1 hour coding session.  \nNot even live code review.; my team doesn't do take home projects at all. i think we do a super easy quiz that's timed for 30 minutes max but should take any qualified candidate maybe 5 minutes to finish. I once helped interview for a position on another team and was surprised to find they don't even do a single technical screen, entire interview is 100% behavioral or talking about projects you worked on before.\n\n15 day projects... blows my mind; It is is significant that the 15-day estimate comes from you and not from them. Maybe the company is scamming you, or maybe the project is not as hard as you think using the best approach. People have come through here before protesting that a coding project was too hard because they approached it ineffectively.; lol are you sure they weren't trying to leech free consulting work from you? Biggest take home assignments i had were a weekend affair and even then I thought they were annoying. Like not even FAANG and other top tier companies do this afaik; Sure, I am desperate for a job, but even I have some self-respect. I am glad I refused to do it a d withdrew my application.; Big brain play: keep stringing them along and saying you’re making good progress and on day 15 when it’s due tell them you accepted another offer and hope they find a great candidate for the position.; It felt way too scummy. I withdrew my application.; I have found a couple of implementations of the problem they asked me to do on github. I haven’t found any that are less than a couple thousand of lines of Python code. The problem domain is same as the one I did my Masters in. I know what I am talking about when I said it would take a long time.; Probably not because their product already has that capability. I think they genuinely want to test my ability. Still, I have my self-respect and I refused to do it outright."

   "Top Comments": "It helps in that you probably have a better shot at getting a referral from someone ay Amazon. It could help if they have an internal hires program too. Otherwise, not really.; If we are talking about getting an SDE role within Amazon itself, it certainly does. You are getting your BA degree in CS and they already have 7 years worth of performance history on you, so they have a pretty good idea of what kind of employee you are. If you were truly lazy and awful, I'm sure they would have fired you ages ago.\n\nOutside of Amazon? I cannot confidently say yes or no, as it will depend on the company and the role itself. Some SDE roles may involve stuff like Linux administration (to a small degree), so IT experience with Linux would be helpful in that case.; I went from AWS cloud support to swe at a different company. Just make sure you highlight your transferable skills on your resume and have good stories ready for interviews; Transfer internally is your best bet. I met people who were in IT, Support being able to transfer to SWE at amazon. Not sure how the process work but i seen it happened; Go on the internal wiki and search for ADA, I believe it stands for Amazon Dev Academy. It's a program specifically for people transitioning to the SDE role from other positions which aren't qualified to make a direct lateral transfer to the SDE role.; Maybe it’ll confuse an automated system into thinking you have relevant FAANG experience, but no, I don’t think with no SWE internships, IT work and a CS degree that you’re particularly competitive for software engineering jobs in today’s market.; With a CS degree, compared to a completely green new grad with no work experience? Absolutely.\n\nCompared to someone with 1 year of dev experience? No; Done it 3 times. Thanks though. I think they discontinued the program for now."

   "Title": "why are internships so hard to get now? was it this hard before?",
   "Top Comments": "There is a HUGE amount of competition in tech job market nowadays. People are using automation and scripts to mass apply whenever there's a new internship listing or job listing. A lot of students are taking CS, so oversaturation is one of the reasons for this too.; From a buddy of mine who’s a CEO: “I get 100 applicants in the first 12 hours of posting.” When asked how to handle them he just said “I swipe through them like tinder. If something doesn’t stand out then I move on immediately. Referrals are auto-interview. It’s ruthless, but idk how else to handle such a high amount of applicants.”\n\nThe key these days really is speed, standing out (somehow) and referrals. [My site updates our listings daily and we focus heavily on startups.](https://talentramp.co); Tons of competition and not as many openings. Our talent acquisition team has no idea how to handle the massive volume of applicants for internships and junior roles.; Talent overflow\n\n\nToo many unemployed people looking for jobs.; Many companies use internships as a way to eventually hire full time junior developers. If there’s no guarantee that interns could be converted into full time employees then a company would be less willing to hire interns (I heard that my company is reducing the size of its intern program and full time new grad program. Really sucks); No, it was not this hard before. There are way too many people in CS. There are also more jobs shipped to India and the Philippines and lots of work visa abuse since they will work for half the going wage.\n\nIt’s not any more complicated than that.\n\nI’m 12 YoE and rate of me getting to the HR screening after an application for a position I’m rather qualified for is about 25% versus 50-75% a few years ago.\n\nLinkedIn mails from recruiters are vast majority trash pay as a contractor with no benefits. Or employee status at a company I’m willing to work for but it’s 20% less than what I get paid now.\n\nI’m super excited to have an interview with everyone on the call being American.; Most companies wrap up their internship recruitment in the late fall/ early winter. Your buddy might just be too late trying to find one for this summer. Their career resource office might be able to help with co-ops if they are willing to take time off during the school year to work; If you look at older posts 6+ years ago. You'd see that people could get internships just by showing off their 2 week shitty cli project from their intro course, basic understanding of sdlc, and resume formatted by a middle schooler.\n\nThe concept of hyperoptimizing a resume and sending out 100s of apps was foreign.; It wasnt this hard before but relatively not THAT simple either. The 2021 covid zero rates market was a bit... \"too easy\" as in it was not intended and not normal for it to be that easy. So you have mass layoffs + everyone looking for jobs who are also new to the field with not as many job postings or creation of new SWE jobs. So technically the answer is always that it's a supply and demand issue since that's just the natural law of scarcity but what is causing this limited demand and absurd supply are factors like we are having a tech/ overall white collar recession.\n\nTech is getting hit extra hard and supply wise it right now is one of the most popular fields still (including globally with offshoring to Europe, South Asia and Latin America being more and more viable) even though the job creation isn't the same as it was mid pandemic. It's still a numbers game but aside from blindly applying you friend should continue to work on personal projects (good projects that has potential to have some success and not just a youtube tutorial of some whatever clone) and show those projects off in career fairs from local / smaller companies. Look at the most common tech stacks for the job postings in your city and tell him to make a project utilizing that stack. Another tip is to literally look for anything tech related and dev adjacent, not specifically SWE. Then IF the market gets better try to make a pivot.; Why? Because the current market is bad.; i interview interns at my company, a very small tech consultantcy (50-60 employees). we used to get maybe 50 applicants, in 2022 we had about 150, in 2023 we had 300+ applicants, and since we went 100% remote this year we had 500+ applicants. \n\ncompetition is super high right now so employers can be really choosey. if i see the generic CS resume with only school projects (basic apps in C, Java, python, little to no UI experience, etc) and no external projects making use of modern frameworks then i wont move that candidate on to the next round.\n\nan example specific to my company: we are currently swamped with a ton of work and since ill be the one training and prepping interns for real world client experience i just dont have the time to do a lot hand holding so if a candidate can hit the ground running because they already have experience with react and/or NextJS then im interested in talking to and working with that candidate. this is where bootcampers are able to show their value.; [removed]; It was hard before, now it's very hard, but soon it will be extremely hard. Key is to get on the monkey floor as soon as possible.; Back in 2020 it was harder for me to find an internship than a job. (Never found an internship) I almost landed one made it to the final round but someone beat me with actual work experience while I was in school… wild.    Not sure now though; Entry level and internships have always been a challenge for obviously reason low skill level low communication level and little to no network. Bad markets like these make things much much worse; I couldn't get an internship back in 2008-2012. Everything worked out fine for me, eventually. It was always very hard to get one if you weren't in a known school or had connections. And it was basically impossible to get a paid one without nepotism, lol.; I got a job instead of an internship when applying just at the end of COVID19.\n\nI must've applied for atleast 100 internships and got no callbacks, so I just started job hunting instead; 1. FED has restricted the supply of new money (to combat the inflation they created during covid) so loans are very expensive. Tech is a loan heavy industry, so VCs are reluctant to fund anything that won't be profitable in a short amount of time.\n2. FAANG companies are trying to keep their stock prices high in a high rate environment. To do this they need to cut costs. They then flood the market with laid off talent, then re-hire at lower salary bands. Facebook is doing this right now.\n3. AI is going to make low level coding jobs much easier, companies know they can run a tighter ship.\n4. Many people are thinking they want to go into tech and get a fat paycheck while working from home and are enticed by scammy offers from bootcamps. There is a glut of new grads that are going to have a terrible time finding work in the industry.; I’ll say that I’m also applying to internships as someone with 7YOE. We need jobs. Bad. I don’t know if companies are hiring experienced engineers for internships, but why would you hire some college kid that knows nothing when you could hire someone who’s been doing it professionally for years?; It’s been this way for years though. I use to get 2500 applicants for 12 interns back in 2016."

   "Top Comments": "Switch to a stats or math major.; Some data science modeling is really interesting. However, the majority of projects require 80-90% of their effort to get the data, figure out what's important in it, before you can do that last 10% in modeling.\n\nFurther, there's a big movement to be \"data driven\" in corporations, but it's not quite what you'd expect, instead of using data to find new ideas or prove a hypothesis, what people overwhelming do is get an idea, then try to find the data and analysis that supports it. There's not a lot of science going on. That, and it's sort hard to communicate uncertainty to stakeholders.\n\nSo I did DS for a little bit at a start up, got a few interesting models in production, then decided to do SWE. Now, like 5 years later, I'm finally going make to ML as a software engineer, and working projects with LLMs. I'm pretty glad I took that detour, since SWE is just a more in-demand job, and brings a lot more utility to the table.; Do you like it; Data science is NOT an entry level role for someone with no real world experience.; I can't unfortunately, but why? Isn't Data Science/Analysis relating to CS?; First of all thank you so much for this detailed answer!! \nTbh the data field doesn't seem as appealing as I thought. \n\nWould you mind if I ask you more about SWE? Because, actually, this is one of the majors I wanted to get in at first, but I took an introduction subject and all the diagrams and models without coding made me move away from it. So, is the field really about those organizational diagrams and assigning tasks to the team underhand, or is there more coding to it?; From what I currently understand about the field, I believe I'm interested yes.; A data scientist is a research scientist. Math chops, research chops, and usually a lot of domain knowledge.; The field is about writing software that helps companies earn more money, or save money.\n\nWhat you actually do, day to day, depends a lot on your experience level, though. When you just start out, you are almost entirely writing code, and working on tasks other people defined. Eventually, you'll reach a competency where you still code, but your greatest impact is just figuring out what to do, and communicating that to the people around you.\n\nMost of my day is writing, reading papers, going to meetings, reviewing peoples work, and coding. Diagrams are a part of that, but I'd consider my main contribution to my team as helping shape the technical direction of other people and ensuring the success of the project.; Misconception cleared. That was absolutely informative. Thank you so much for writing this!"

Start practicing and solving tech problems.  If you can get CS degree, get CS degree.  CS degree helps vast majority of people, that have earned CS degree.\n\nIt's a journey of thousand miles type thing.  Start walking.; You’ll need a degree to get a job in this market anyways my dude; I have a degree and a bootcamp too, still don’t get offers if that helps you😂; I wish i could say it gets easier but it doesn't.\n\nKeep working on projects and practicing your skills. I wish i could say your bootcamp was enough, but right now not even people with degrees and experience are getting jobs.; I’m sure this is probably hard to hear, but the truth is that a bootcamp isn’t enough to get a job anymore. Alternatively, a masters in CS could get you a entry level job if you have a bachelors degree in an unrelated field. Maybe that could be an option for you; 1. Be calm. Self-induced stress doesn’t help focus.\n2. For development, nothing is more important than hands-on experience. If you can get a job even an entry level one to start getting industry experience that’s your best choice.\n3. While looking for a job you should build things and write things. Create a tech blog. Build things and commit to your GitHub and blog about what you are learning and doing with code samples and screenshots and whatnot. \n\nGood luck! I’ve been doing it for over 20 years in industry (and many years before it as a hobby); I’m a SWE with about 6 years and CS degree with very bad ADHD. The best way I’ve learned, is to try to gamify my learnings. To this day I still try to make a game out of learning something. It’s very difficult for me to focus on a task for 2-3 hours without checking my phone or doing something else.\n\nSo, I will incentivize myself. If I can focus for 1 hour straight, no distractions I give my self 7 minutes for a hobby. Then I get right back into it. Now granted, this works most of the time, and there are always fires that happen at my job and I have to focus for 3-12 hours wt some point to fix some bug or whatever it may be, and during those times the adrenaline kicks in and it allows me to focus.\n\nMy best advice, try to gamify your learnings. \nYou’re at a severe disadvantage with only a boot camp degree sadly. The market is very tough right now, and students fresh out of college with a degree can’t get a job, and companies would rather hire them, than a boot camp student.\n\nBuild something, build something. Builder a timer app in a new framework, build an api about your favorite tv show or movie, anything. Just type something.. it’s a lucrative career for a reason, it’s difficult. \n\nYou can do it man, but you really need to find a way to work around your ADHD, for me it took a couple of years to find a way that works the best.; ADHD programmer here.\n\nThe key is to keep your expectations in check with reality. Boot camps are a great way to prepare yourself for a CS degree. Your goal is one step at a time.\n\nYou want to practice solving problems every day until you learn how to think critically so that you don’t feel like you need to “remember” stuff. Your goal is to train your brain to problem solve, not give memorized solutions.; I did a year long bootcamp and still felt the same way after completion, though most of it was my lack of enthusiasm for it all due to external circumstances. I got lucky and connected with a dev in China via LinkedIn, and together we got contracts via Upwork. I still needed to keep up with everything and have a decent idea of what was going on. I used JavaScript Mastery’s YouTube channel a lot to help build projects. \n\nHonestly, if I was going to do it again, I’d go and get a 2 year CS degree of some nature. Bootcamp + self study didnt cut it, at least for me. I’m a massage therapist now lol; I doubt you learned it if you forgot it that quickly. I would review the stuff you should have learned, like a single programming language, and write programs with that.; The completion rate of the average online class is about 3% so it is normal that you can’t finish them.; I think you'll need a degree in this tech market to get a job. The market is really bad right now, and it's really hard to survive in it without a degree. A bootcamp surely does help.\n\nAlso don't lose hope, believe in yourself. It'll all be okay.; Boot camps are scams.... They're just designed to take your money.; Are bootcamps still a thing? Y’all are crazy; Well your first mistake was taking a bootcamp. Sorry you didn't do enough research before spending that money. You'll want a degree in this economy, the boot camps are just snakeoil.; Doesn't get any easier my guy, this is the most basic part\nIn this job market you need a degree anyways tho, so I don't see what's the rush.\nStart your degree and in 4 years time you should be competent enough to do leetocode, start grinding that and applying at that point; Honestly, you probably just want to pursue a different career. And definitely talk to a doctor and/or therapist.; Sorry man, this might sound harsh but you expect someone to pay you for non-existent skills in this economy just because you finished a bootcamp? There are other ways to make money, I would start looking there instead of wasting time. Or go back to collage for a cs degree…; I believe applying your skills will help things stick. Instead of just studying a bunch of abstract things, try building an app and just tinkering with it to solve various problems. This helps make things tangible for you, and can also be a good talking point if you land the interview.; If you’re willing to work 4-8 hours per day (on top of your day job or hopefully you can subsist on your savings) for at least a year straight with DAILY effort without any breaks or expectations of a reward and just get your skills up, you have a chance. \n\nOn top of that, you need to spend the rest of your time networking in person and build connections in the industry."

   "Top Comments": "15 years ago all the talk was about offshoring tech jobs to India. The cycle repeats.; Then you get back up and climb higher.\n\nThere are gazillions of problems in tech.  ALL companies are always looking for people that can solve problems, INCLUDING companies affected by downward trend.; Market does well > People get attracted > Bad actors (shitty bootcamps) exploit it > Market gets saturated > Tourists get wrecked and leave > Market gets restored > Cycle repeats.\n\nIt's like investing, people join at the top and then wonder why it doesn't keep going up and eventually give up because it's not easy money. Since the market and its different fields are strong, it recovers and a new wave of tourists arrives.; Honestly I really feel like influencers ruined it, like they’ve ruined so many other things. Even stuff outside of tech, 1 example is how bali is getting destroyed right now because all these influencers made it the number 1 cheapest place to go for vacation; It's not hard to see old posts from a decade ago talking about 'oversaturation' or offshoring. There's not a lot of evidence that CS underemployment is even high relative to most college majors. Vast majority of people are still finding jobs.\n\n  \nI think there's a bimodal distribution of people who suck and those who are rockstars on here. The vast middle is left underrepresented.; Waste not, want not.; IT has been a meme for the past 10 years; \"The higher you climb, the harder you fall\" implies it's the same people making the claims.\n\n\nBut it's fairly well established that the people complaining are the 0YOE people. Many of the people making 3+ hundies w/ good WLB are still around; it's just that for obvious reason, it's tasteless to brag now.; [deleted]; This is such a stupid post lol. All those people still have their jobs. They haven’t fallen. Just people who don’t have jobs have it harder to *get* a job, which sucks really bad, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the title of this post.; I mean... no, that's not remotely true?  It's way worse to lose your job when you're just scraping by.  How do people posting here have so little perspective?; unspoken part is you can also swing back high\n  \nbetween 2021 to today my TC went something like ~300k -> ~240k (due to stock crash) -> 0 (due to layoff) -> ~320k (upcoming job)\n  \nthe other part you're missing is once you climb that high and have big tech to your name you're no longer afraid to tell companies this ain't a good fit (remember the endless \"not a good fit\" from company side? you can now say that as candidate side too), not to mention the amount of savings (that you should have) over the years meaning you're not desperate/can be in a relatively stronger position to negotiate; Things come and go in trends. Alas people flexing about their 250k salaries are representing a small minority of developers.\n\nOverall it would be good for people to have some humility. If you're working an ordinary work week and making noticeably more money than the median full-time employee, you prolly shouldn't complain all that much about your compensation or lack of work hours.\n\nMany of us are one major negative life-event or mental health event or an injury away from our living standards plummeting. Or one downturn, for that matter.; Yep. I remember a Meta Recruiter posted a TikTok video of basically doing nothing yet pulling $150k a year. She had received quite a lot of swag from meta. This was during covid when millions were getting laid off across different industries and here’s this 21 year old just cruising through life posting on TikTok. There were also quite a few posters on ig stating that they left their Microsoft SDE roles and were now the CEO of their own company of 1. Karma bites back hard.; everyone i know that was making 250k+ TC a few years back is still doing that, including the ones who were laid off.; Just over a year ago I was making 6 digits and working for an amazing company. I could travel. I had a great work life balance… I was paying off my debt. Life was great! Dream life accomplished… then I was laid off as part of a 12% reduction. I haven’t been able to find work that allows me to travel or live abroad which sucks because I’m engaged to be married to a Costa Rican woman. I’ve lowered my pay expectations from $100k+ to $40k and still can’t find anything.\n\nIt’s truly depressing.; Some of us still working remote from the fishing boat.  We build software to serve non-tech industries.; It's almost as if having too little to do for a top-10% salary band was a sign of something to come...; And Google is no longer prestigious; Race wars?"

If companies want skills in Snowflake and Databricks, go learn Snowflake and Databricks. Obviously you should spend time on interview questions and caring for yourself, but in terms of just getting through interviews, having domain specific knowledge on a high paying skill is extremely valuable to companies.; If you love building things it shows. Find a project that excites you, get into learning the details of some interesting tech, and make something cool. \n\nYou'll learn a ton and it may help you land a job: I personally really admire looking over actual finished things so build something end-to-end and it has helped sway me towards candidates in the past.; As a remote dev, I like giving code talks to imaginary audiences. Sounds odd, but speaking about complex topics in a coherent way is a very important skill. You also catch gaps in your own knowledge when doing so. You also become a better speaker, which is invaluable in all domains of life. \n\nAlso all the taking care of yourself stuff that other people mentioned, especially sleep.

   "Title": "For people who are Senior/Staff/Principal SWEs at big tech companies, how much of your time is spent in meetings vs coding",
   "Top Comments": "I hardly ever code any more, but that isn't necessarily because of meetings. A lot of planning work, writing and reviewing documentation, defining tasks, debugging failures, helping teammates, preparing presentations, etc.; About 20% meetings, 60% unblocking others and 40% coding as a senior at Oracle. \n\nYeah you read those percentages right ☠️; I generally spend about 1/2 of my time in meetings or chats as a Senior at G (who expects a staff promo soon).; Easily over 50% of my time is meetings, and some days it’s quite literally 100% stacked back to back to back, with me needing to choose between conflicts. Probably half of that is focused, half of that is stuff I need to be at but can do some light work in the background with camera off. 25% of my time is spent communicating on slack/email.\n\nThe other 25% is technical, but rarely coding. Writing or reviewing docs, reviewing code, investigating whatever shit has decided to fuck itself that week. I regularly need to log in on evenings to get focused work done, for better or worse. (Golden handcuffs I guess.)\n\nIf I get the coding itch I usually just do that on my own time for a side project. At work, it’s better if I lay down a design and let a junior own delivery. Sometimes I’ll have to roll up my sleeves and bang something out if it’s urgent. If I’m doing my job well, this shouldn’t be regular.; At senior, I'd spend maybe 10% of time in meetings. At staff, between 20-30%. My peers at sr staff+ tend to spend more; Staff at FAANG. I spend maybe 5% of my time doing IC coding work. Most of my time is spent unblocking my team, not necessarily just attending meetings.; It varies from week to week. I’ve had some time recently where coding for 80-90% of it was the best use of my time, but it’s not uncommon to have weeks with 0 coding whatsoever.; Only about 25% max at my current company, staff level.  Previous companies though, at senior was more like 60%+.  Getting it down to 25% was very intentional and partly a product of layoffs.  There’s so much work that can be (and needs to be IMO) done that the more meetings I go to the more work I would try to do.  So now I only go to meetings I’m absolutely required for or find really interesting.; Got the opportunity to be tech lead and suddenly my days were 70% meetings. I hated it and was getting burnt out so I switched back to senior SWE. Now I have barely any meetings and get to focus on coding again which has been amazing. I don't even mind if I stay senior SWE forever. I already make more than enough money, and I value enjoying my time at work over making more $; I'm not currently, but when I was it was 2 hours minimum, and on bad days I'd barely have time to take lunch between meetings, if at all.; It ebbs and flows. Sometimes it’s zero coding for weeks. Other times it’s 50% coding. When things get really bad I get put on projects and in a standup with jira tickets. Actually my company has a metric for whether leads are coding and expect you to have some code push every performance cycle. It’s not high but they want to weed out no code architect type positions. \n\nI’m on the product side. Infra is a lot more involved.; I don't work as a SWE, I just study it as a hobby, but I can tell you the answer. They're spending less time doing technical work and more time in meetings. This happens in every career--for the most part. You get better at doing your task-oriented work and can do it much faster than when you were a junior or an associate. So it's not necessarily that you're doing less \"work\" per se, it's more so that you're more efficient with your work and you can tackle it while also going to meetings.\n\nIf you work in a law firm the older attorneys will know most of the areas of law that the firm practices and can tell you which lines of cases or statutes pertain to specific causes of action. They don't need to spend time on Lexis or Westlaw researching everything. Same thing for financial analysts. They've done so many DCAs and they look at the market so often that they can usually prototype some kind of analysis for you very quickly where as a new associate might need a few hours. \n\nThis is why you also shouldn't get discouraged with working. Sure, working the first few years might be a grind--but once you learn how to do the work your life becomes easier. You make more money, people depend on you, you can take on more responsibilities. It's pretty cool.; Working on cloud systems in large consulting companies, the people who do all the designing hardly do most of the coding. They’re called software or solution architects. They will research what is possible and may write some code as a proof of concept, but it does not go into production. \n\nThey are the technical leaders on teams, typically. Most of the engineers supporting them are senior level too, i.e. make decisions on code structure.; I spend about 10% of my week on overhead. Status reports, time tracking sheets, and meetings.; You’re eventually gonna stop coding as much. It’ll move to design and then very high level stuff. What do you want out of your career?; [removed]; i only code if i do it after hours; I hardly code anymore, my technical output is primarily architecture, planning, and code reviews.; At large tech companies it completely depends on the org/dept. ; Staff SWE at a big co., and working as a TL-of-TLs on a team of \\~15 (I work with three TLs who own particular areas our team drives, and I'm responsible for keeping an eye on things & getting involved more when necessary. I also provide support / design reviews / etc. to engineers & leads across a team of several hundred in specific areas of feature design/implementation.)\n\nI spend about 40% of my time in meetings, most weeks, but I'm also spending a lot of time working on documents, root causing issues before handing off fixing them to someone else, doing code reviews, data analysis, figuring out medium/long term strategy & writing it down, participating in postmortems for our larger product area, etc.  There's definitely a good bit of \"putting work into the hopper\" that I wind up doing (i.e. getting feedback from folks or identifying patterns in postmortems, figuring out how to generalize it & scope it for another person on the larger team to do, etc.).\n\nThe amount of time I spend actually /coding/ is usually somewhere around a \\~half day each week on average.  I try to set aside an afternoon for it, and try to do so, because it's something I enjoy.  So I'm spending somewhere around 10% of my time for actual coding.  It's usually not the \"most impactful\" thing I could be doing with that time, to be honest, but it keeps me happy & I think that's also important to balance. :)\n\nObviously, some weeks, it'll be more (e.x. when I get into the implementation of something I'm pushing after it's approved) and some weeks it's less (e.x. when I'm trying to get a dozen people to agree that a design I've proposed will work & solve a problem, or when we're doing organizational planning for the next 6-12 months), but 10% is somewhere around the \\~average in my experience."

That being said, > 10% is probably excessive."

However, if you have to earn money to eat food, you do what you gotta do.  \n\nAt the same time, you have to look into best ways to advance career aspirations.  Does a full time non tech job advance career aspirations?\n\nMany people willingly give up more pay, to further education and career aspirations, many times accepting any tech roles to get started and advance.; Yeah I'm in the same boat. Internships are as hard to get as jobs to be honest. Is there anyway to actually get an internship? Should I just mass apply to remote ones or look locally?"

   "Title": "This sub is a racist cesspool - but it’s against Indian Americans so it’s fine. ",
   "Top Comments": "I think a lot of people group h1b Indians with non h1b Indians. The h1bs are literally taking our jobs for worse pay, they are a reason that many can't find a job. It's not really their fault though, it's the systems fault. H1b visas shouldn't even be a thing for tech right now.  ; Two broad thoughts:\n\n1. Yes, a lot of people are very racist against any demographic that they see as competition, and in SW, that is Asians. You're gonna get pushback on the way you framed your post, but there's absolutely racism in... well, everything. Having said that....\n\n2. Your argument is trash because you're describing the top 1% of indian tech workers. Yes - I went to grad school in the US with a bunch of guys who graduated from IIT Madras and they were some of the smartest people I've met. But is every Indian tech worker in the US now IIT material? Not even a little bit.\n\nSo again - I agree with your general argument - the job market is bad and so tech workers see all these foreigners and get resentful. And then the racism comes out.\n\nBut your argument - or really your evidence - is bad.; I am South Asian, and I hate the way Indians are being abused with the H1B system to suppress the salaries of Americans. It’s not just white people being affected, it’s all minorities who worked hard to get to where they are, only to be outcompeted by cheap captive labor.; Honestly some of the comments I see are fucking insane. I don't get it. I'm fortunate to never meet indian coworkers who suck or these jerks who say racist things about them on the internet. \n\nIt's weird seeing this dichotomy online between indian workers who work 169 hours a week to not get fired but are also lazy and don't want to do any work. What? \n\nRealistically, I've worked with a bunch, and for the most part, I'd say my indian coworkers are generally friendly, helpful and talented. It takes a certain level of skill and privilege to be able to change countries for a better life, so I think this makes sense. Sure, there's a skill variance to reflect that there's a massive amount of the workplace, but I think most people who are talking shit online are mostly just mad in their own lives.; When talking to my Indian friends (and even coworkers), they themselves would just openly start bashing other Indians ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n[Related](https://new.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/1bkx2zi/indians_in_canada/); [deleted]; H1B’s are literally an evil. They only hire other H1B’s and they severely undercut American jobs. If you are white (or any other race other than Indian) and the interview panel is all Indians, you are literally screwed. You will get grilled. Meanwhile, the other Indian candidate will get easy questions and get hired no matter what. \n\nHR loves it because they can underpay them and grab them by the balls because they will die before going back to India (since it’s so beautiful there). They will work 80 hour weeks because their sponsorship is a matter of life or death. \n\nWe have MASSIVE layoffs right now yet still approve 85k H1B. It’s fucking stupid. We Americans need to look after our own citizens before immigrants, like Indians in India should look after Indians. Our own citizens are struggling, they should come first. AMERICANS.SHOULD.COME.FIRST.IN.AMERICA. \n\nAlso, if you think this sub is racist than you must be new to internet. You should’ve been around for late 2000s 4chins. You don’t know what real racism is. \n\nH1B shouldn’t be tech right now. There is ZERO tech shortage. H1B should adapt for jobs that are genuinely in shortage. H1B should be for truck drivers, oil rig workers, flight attendants, teachers, welders etc. You know, jobs that are ACTUALLY in shortage. \n\nIt’s a shame because Indians in India are hard working as fuck. I’ve been there before. I’ve seen them grind. The only ones who come here though are the entitled ones who want the high paying, comfy jobs. They think they’re too good for the labor jobs because of their caste system. Shit dude, some of them think they’re good for any company other than ‘high prestige FAANG’. Just go on Blind if you don’t believe me and you’ll see it. Then they get laid off and beg for a referral before having to go back to India. That humbles them real quick. \n\nI had a well off Indian co-worker who had a maid back home and would routinely talk about her as if she was a dog. They have no respect for those who put in hard work and sweat.; I've never enjoyed a team more than when mine was 70% Indian (in-office role). Spent four years on that team, always count my blessings that it was the team I landed on as a jr.\n\nEntirely anecdotal with a sample size of 1 but I did not perceive any bias from my manager (who was also Indian). She was entirely results oriented.; There’s two sides of the story: \n- Americans absolutely suck at studying Leetcode. (Whether ethnically Indian, Chinese, white, whatever)\n- Immigrants do tend to hire their own. \n\nHaving worked at 3 MAANGs it’s not uncommon to see an Indian manager with a team that’s 90% Indian. Same with Chinese. Whether that’s due to racial preference or reference, depends. I knew an Indian Director at Amazon with 20 years tenure — he once told a few colleagues that he “supports the killings of Muslims in India.” So you can imagine the types of folks he was inclined to hire. \n\nAmericans are good and creative, would love to work with more of them, but 95% have no discipline when it comes to actually studying Leetcode. A few times I gave very direct coaching to Americans before the interview, telling them exactly what problems to study, and they didn’t even do that. \n\nSo, yeah. That’s why Indian and Chinese immigrants are taking all your jobs, lol. There are two sides to it.; Never seen posts about Indian Americans specifically. The posts usually call out **h1b** Indians behavior which is 100% true from personal experience at 3 companies.; Because the hate is so undeserved. It’s not like we saw an Indian once and automatically hated them. Everything started from something.  \nFirst it was a few then they got into leadership and the whole sector of that company is suddenly 99% Indian.  \n\nIt’s not that we don’t acknowledge your struggle. It’s that we hate your extreme nepotism.; For the last few years, people have been told that anybody can be an SE with just a bootcamp or by bring \"self taught\". What they weren't also told was that those cases are few and far in between all the others who have poured a lot of time and dedication into learning SE\n\n\nThis was specially more pronounced after 2020 when SWE jobs skyrocketed due to the pandemic and the upward trend was expected to sustain. Little did they realize that crypto and pandemic were not normal. But now that they've made the switch but can't find jobs, they're angry at the easiest target; If you guys think that its really easy and unfair that Indians get jobs let me tell you guys a story about my brother working at Microsoft.\n\n2012 he passed 10th grade and entered high school, now you guys might think that high school is all fun right? WRONG! thats not how it works here, he was admitted to a coaching institute to prepare for an engineering entrance exam called JEE, he used to study for 12 hours a day when the exam was months away and had no regular school and no social interactions.\n\na million people competed for admissions into the best national universities called IITs, and only 65ish people get the top one, he was one of them but all he did was improve his skills with no college life.\n\nHe was given a job offer after 6 years of preparation.\n\nAnd people have the audacity to say that Indians are hired on preferential basis \n\nand no one here cant just focus on skills cuz then youd have no way of going to a good college as those require you to crack on of the hardest undergraduate exams in the world; [removed]; You're american born.\n\nWe hate the h1b and offshore perpetual lying frauds that compose 9/10 of all the bullshit at work day in day out.; Not free, just they favor yall heavily; meh, I just see those people as complaining \"I can't get a job so I gotta find someone or something to blame\"\n  \nsuper old tale and super common in turbulent times; It's usually two-pronged on here:\n\n1. People think they are 'taking er jerbs'\n\n2. Indian culture sucks\n\n  \nThe first one isn't necessarily racist but it is xenophobic. AFAIK, there's no economic data that supports this idea that Indians are depriving the native work force of these jobs, or taking more than they add back in value to the economy to create new dev jobs.\n\n  \nThe second one is totally valid and largely depends on preference. Caste system? Pretty dumb and terrible to just about anyone who doesn't benefit from it.; OP, why waste time complaining here? This subreddit is made for low IQ paleskin neckbeards descended from looters and genociders!; I will add a little interesting thing I noticed. During the trump years all the closeted racists in my office came out in a subtle manner and they would feel so good when H1B workers got laid off due to visa issues. You should have seen their faces when all the jobs went to immigrants from Africa. Hating Indians for their willingness to sacrifice for a better future will not secure your future. It’s a rabbit hole of reasons and at the end of it all is dollar dominance as world currency. Two people can do the exact same work in different parts of the world and will have very different lifestyles. The only way to have a better life is by earning dollars and that will not change anytime soon. My analysis may be flawed but this is what I could come up with."

   "Title": "How do you network?",
   "Top Comments": "A common misconception is that \"networking\" means cold messaging recruiters, or messaging strangers on LinkedIn, or talking to someone on Reddit, or going to some tech meetup where you shake hands and exchange business cards with other desperate SWE's.\n\nThat's not networking.\n\nNetworking is *making friends.* The reason meetup is a great way to \"network\" is because it's a great way to *make friends*. You're going to an event full of people that you have something in common with, you all enjoy the topic of the meetup. That's how friendships are formed. Common interests.\n\nNotably, they don't even need to be technical. You can go to your favorite dive bar, meet a stranger who you hit it off with, and that person is now *part of your network*. As you are theirs. That dude you met who works in marketing? Guess what his company is hiring? SWE's. They can absolutely refer you. Referrals are sanity checks, and get your foot in the door. They're not full on technical assessments. I've given my non-tech friends referrals several times.\n\nA \"network\" is people that like each other enough that they'd vouch for them to their employer. It's not strangers just jerking each other off.\n\nSo get out and make friends. There's also no \"quick\" approach to this. It takes time to form a friendship. If I met you at a meetup and on day 1 you asked if my company had any openings, I'd GTFO. I don't like being used. But if we had been talking regularly for several months, I'd be happy to refer you.\n\nAlso understand networking is not the only way to get a job.... I've only ever gotten 1 interview from my network, and I didn't even get that job. All my other jobs have been from cold applications online. I could use my network if I was ever in a tough spot after a layoff or something, but I haven't had to do that to date.; Networking comes naturally when you're social and put yourself in positions where you can come in contact with others in the industry. When you're working or in school, that typically means building up a rapport with colleagues/classmates. You can also attend meetups, events or even just through unrelated hobbies (I got a job interview and offer from someone in my rec sports league). Collaborating with others on open source projects is another option.; once you start working in industry a lot of your day to day friends are likely also people working in the same field at different companies. Basically they'll vouch for you, friends of friends will vouch for you and so on. The \"network\" is the people you know personally, and the people they know. It doesn't have to be anything grandiose. I'm more than happy to refer a friend of a friend who maybe we had coffee with once a few years ago.\n\nOn the other hand, new grads cold contacting (from perspective of a SWE, not a recruiter) on LinkedIn feels a bit disingenuous and to be frank a little bit annoying. I definitely recommend setting up a LinkedIn and keeping it updated as a digital resume (my current job was actually from someone reaching out on LinkedIn about a role on their team), but treat that more as a passive background exercise.\n\nAlternatives- when I was an intern one of the full-time devs told me he got that role through a tech conference. Technology meetups/conferences seems like a more organic networking event. Everyone there is on the same page about being there to learn about tech, meet other people, and in some cases hire people.; My networking comes from meeting people in my social hobbies like pickleball and arts & crafts. I’ve met many other software developers/engineers and those in HR and management.; Eh,  don't use social media before meeting anyone ; [removed]; Are you a student? Become friendly with your classmates\n\nAre you currently working? Become friendly with your coworkers\n\nI joined my company about a 2 years ago and a lot of people were still remote, which made it a bit difficult to network with coworkers especially as a new grad. When our company joined into a hybrid schedule, I was able to get to know by coworkers better and one of the senior devs was really into running just like me. We were able to bond and become friendly over this, and overtime he introduced me to other managers and senior devs at my company; [removed]; Straight facts!

Could be something else like rock climbing, or whatever you personally enjoy doing.\n\nMeeting like-minded people that you could become friends with is what's important.\n\nMeetup aside, you can meet people by just going outside. My dive bar example was real. I've met many people at my local dive that I now consider good friends that I'd be happy to refer, and I know they'd be happy to refer me if I needed it. Go to a bar.

Go to career fairs, apply online.\n\nI've only been to technology meetups through work tbh, and pretty rarely.

   "Top Comments": "If my compensation is below market rate I'm definitely putting in minimal effort; You should do whatever you want to do.  For me when I agree to take a job you get my good faith effort for the agreed upon work week.  That doesn't mean I never say No to things or overwork myself. I push back all the time against things.\n\nI don't clock watch as I leave work at natural stopping points.  That may be early one day or later the next day. I find it all evens out at the end of the year.  I take my PTO appropriately and give weeks or months of advance notice, based on the length.\n\nI consider work anything I do for the company and not just fingers to keyboard coding.  That means emails, meetings, documentation, mentoring, etc... that's all work to me.\n\nMy average day for a 40-hour work week is:\n\n* 6-hours work\n* 1-hour lunch\n* 1-hour of cumulative breaks; It did at first. \n\nGoing from 7.25 an hour to 11$ an hour definitely meant \"50% more effort\". Going to $22 afterwards also meant twice as much. (Since we don't get paid overtime, it meant more hours per week)\n\nHowever, after being exposed to people who make 500k+ per week for \"keeping clients happy\" by saying yes to absolutely anything that's asked of them while snorting coke off the client's dick, the connection between compensation and effort kinda disappeared. \n\nThe only connection that still exists is profit generated vs compensation. If my team of 10 generates 10m of profit, we better see at least 30% in our paychecks.; For the first month, yes. Then I’m back to generally slacking.; Depends on the hours required for the 4-day work week. Is it still 40 hours, meaning 10 hours a day? Or is it actually 8 hours a day?\n\nIf it is 40 hours, then I absolutely want market rate.\n\nIf it is 32 hours (because 8 hours a day), then I am willing to get paid a bit under market rate, yes.; I _used_ to think I would. In my head, I was getting paid for a normal level of effort and if I had a job that paid me more, I would try harder. \n\nThen, I got a much better paying job. Like, an unfathomably large increase for me (3x the salary I thought was fair). I went from a Midwestern company to a near FAANG level big tech company. \n\nAt first, I really thought I would work so much harder. I wanted to be the best I could be. But I very, very quickly realized my large tech company employer was basically dysfunctional. My boss was not technical and seemed to have trouble remembering what I even did. And yet, he was the only voice that mattered during my reviews.\n\nHe didn't have visibility to my work and he mostly didn't care. I genuinely don't understand how he got his job or how he has a successful career. He has since been promoted, but I have too, so I'm still reporting to him. \n\nWorse still, the product I work on is inconsequential to this giant company. It's a rounding error in the revenue they get, even though it's bringing in *millions* of dollars. The company doesn't care about it and are actively making it worse, on purpose, because they don't want customers using it. \n\nYeah, it's ridiculous. \n\nSo, yeah, money alone wasn't enough to get me to work hard. The real motivation for me was the belief that there was a direct correlation between my pay and effort. Without that, I just don't care much. Thankfully, my boss's incompetence means he has no idea what I'm doing and seems to assume I'm performing adequately.; All that matters to me is doing my job and my family justice at the same time. A 4 day work week just means that you end up working longer on the 4 days so you can get an entire day off\n\n\nRealistically in SE, you don't clock 40 hrs every week. You get an assigned quantum of work. Some weeks you work 10 hours and on other weeks, you work 60. A good boss and management system will ensure that you're well compensated and reasonably happy in both these phases; Nice try HR, not telling you!; Going to be the person that says no. I used to think the answer was yes but then realized the underlying issue was that I had lost passion for what I was doing years ago. I hit the career reset button and even though I took a salary hit, I ended up much more motivated and happy doing something completely new. The title and compensation bits are easy to achieve if you genuinely love what you do. When you don’t, success will make you miserable. You don’t want to live that way.; Incidentally, when you’re underpaid that’s usually when your company wants the most from you lol; As much as people hate to hear it, I think it's true that salary has very little direct correlation to the day-to-day effort someone puts in. Your pay check is just too decoupled from your daily work to create a good reenforcement mechanism. People tend to have an innate level of motivation or work ethic. That motivation and work ethic varies over time with their personal circumstances, the work environment and how interested they are in what they are doing, etc.\n\nPeople with a strong work ethic can often successfully demand more money, and companies that pay more can be more selective and focus on hiring and retaining people with a high work ethic, so big picture there's probably a relationship between productivity and pay, but giving someone a raise tends to only have a short term impact on productivity before they go back to their natural steady state. Cutting someone's pay, on the other hand, is a lot more likely to cause them to check out and become permanently less productive. That's related less to salary though and more to someone feeling under-valued. If someone felt like taking a pay cut along with gaining a 4 day work with was a fair deal then my expectation is that they'd retain the same level of productivity overall.\n\nIncidentally, that's why my advice to people is typically that a 4 day work week is a bad deal. I think most people end up being about the same level of productive and taking a pay cut. Your much better off negotiating some flexibility with your manager directly.; I work harder when the problem interests me more regardless of money tbh; Yes. I know how to work efficiently and at the same time manage workload to avoid over delivery. Over delivery can lead to inefficiency; In general, no. My job has gotten easier the more I have gotten paid.\n\nSalary/Compensation are almost entirely based on three things:\n\n1. **Company you're working for:** Bigger budget & More competitive -> More pay.\n2. **Location:** Higher CoL -> More pay.\n3. **Experience:** More YoE / Recognizable company names -> More pay.\n\nBonus consideration for industry. Passion industries like gamedev pay less.; There's two ways to think about it, hourly rate and value-add. If you go by hourly rate, then yes, less hours == less salary. But if you go by value-add, no, the math is a boolean \"do you bring enough to justify the price tag\".\n\nBut either way, there doesn't need to be a direct correlation between compensation and effort. Otherwise, a CEO would have to work 100x more than you. Work smart instead.; Yes, my pay is much higher than I ever thought it would be. When I was applying around, my current job offered me 2 times more than the other 4 job offers I got. I treat my company as if it's some kind of god I serve and revere.; I have my own standards for the effort I put in at work, or anything else.  It's gonna cost 8 hours of my life no matter what.; Absolutely.  The company is explicitly telling you what value they have assigned you with the comp package.  It's not entitlement to reciprocate the relationship tone they set.; FWIW I've been on a 32 hour work week for a few years. It is awesome. It was completely worth the lower salary to me for a while. I'm kind of done now and willing to work 5 days for higher pay, but if the salary you're offered is high enough, I say go for it. It's especially nice if you have a family, or other obligations that take up your weekends. \n\n\nI don't think totally compensation doesn't impact my work effort. Lack of raises does though. When I've gone more than a year without getting a raise I wonder what the point is. Shy time I start to consider working outside of work hours, I make myself apply to jobs instead lol.; Yes, as does work life balance. I can handle working a lot for a strong salary but I won’t tolerated never having time off unless I’m HEAVILY compensated."

I didn't know its expensive to conduct those background checks too. Your explanation gives a lot of reason why offer letter should be done first so yeah...super strange. Thanks for explaining this! I'm looking at the recruiters email and it's \\[name\\]@\\[company\\].org. Nothing strikes me as weird so far with the email. I also checked their website and use [scamadvisor.com](http://scamadvisor.com) to vet this and looked at the companys linkedin... everything seems to be fine so far. Yeah I'm not sure but I'll keep my guard up.; Yea they are not individually expensive but if you consider that they. have to run them on a huge number of unnecessary people that adds a lot of operating costs as well as time because they take 2 weeks and in that time the candidate can have accepted another offer. Gl!; > \\[name\\]@\\[company\\].org\n\nIs the company's website company.org?; True that! I already have 4 other interviews going on. Not putting all my eggs on something as sketch as this. You're the real MVP for walking me through this. Thanks for the advice and wishes :) I'll just have to keep on pushing through interviews until I get an offer letter; yes; Maybe you can help me by telling me how you're getting so many interviews 😂; This might seem weird to suggest, but copy the domain from the email address and paste it into a browser, to see if it takes you to the company website. Some characters will have the same visual representation, but have a different number under the hood. For instance the Cyrillic 'a' is 208 in ASCII, and the Latin 'a' is 97. Both would look exactly the same, but a computer doesn't care because it understands numbers and not letters.\n\nIf you find that the website is in fact the company's website, this process might be a little unorthodox, but it is likely legit, imo.\n\nAlso, check to see if anyone on Glassdoor mentions this hiring process for the company.; Optimize the resume then spray and pray strat on linkedin, indeed, and zip recruiter. Dice works too but you get a lot of garbage jobs but if you are ok with that then you're good to go. Right now I think 3 of my interviews alone are from Dice and 1 is through staying connected with a past recruiter last year.; That's a very interesting idea I never thought of that! I tried it just now and it did take me to the company site so it must be legit. There's about a 100 reviews on glass door. Some mixed stuff in there but reading this is making me more sure this is a legit company. So that's good....not a scam probably but just a weird hiring proccess.\n\nEdit: lol I just found out this company did a layoff during the big project. In pretty sure the job I applied for is that big project so this place is trying to find cheap labor I think.; Thanks it sounds like the usual method I use (numbers game) but I'm glad to know it's working for you even in this market, keep going and you'll get that offer.; Cheers! Glad to hear it.\n\nMost of the scammers I have encountered while job hunting are pretty lazy, but they can get clever.\n\nI'm usually prompted by email to download a `totally-unsuspicious-tech-assessment-for-your-very-good-job.PDF` file that supposedly contains the take home assessment information which must be completed urgently to move forward, lol. And their email is always something like [company]-jobs.com like why the fuck would their hr department use an entirely separate domain, lmao."

   "Title": "Anybody else feel like the “hop jobs to get promotions” culture helped destroy the junior developer role?",
   "Top Comments": "A few years ago, people were saying that a CS career was no good because older developers were being pushed out by younger developers.; Dude, I was being underpaid at my previous company, ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY'S OWN POLICY. \n\nBy the company's own written policy, I should have been making atleast 115k-120k based in my years of experience and education. I was making 98k at the time.\n\nI brought this up with management, and eventually they agreed. But even then they couldn't guarantee a pay increase to that range because such a pay increase from my current salary would be \"too big\" and \"would not look good\". \n\nIt would have taken YEARS to crawl up to that pay level through annual raises. \nSo you know what? I job searched. And I got multiple job offers offering between 140k, 142k. \n\nSo I jumped ship.\n\nIf these fucking companies want to retain their talent they need to quit being so retarded with how they pay their employees.\n\nAnd I do feel sorry for junior devs. But I think long term, they'll be fine.; Say thanks to the upper layers that provide so low pay raises. If the company have good pay raises, no one will left or at least not so much people as happened; You don't have to justify or partake, but nobody is wrong for chasing a check. You wouldn't have as much jumping if salaries were fair to begin with, which is why transparency is important.; It is not just in CS that job hoping for promotion and pay raises happen. It happens in all industries and it is really nuts. \n\nThat being said most of my big pay raises have been from when I switch jobs.; Who is paying $160k for a junior dev besides maybe FAANG in HCOL areas?\n\nI think $160k for a junior dev is highly uncommon outside of FAANG.; At the same time, the culture of \"You won't even get an annual raise to keep up with inflation unless you have a competing offer,\" contributes to job hopping. If companies wanted retention, they would pay their current employees competitively.; Prior to the pandemic and remote work explosion, the number of junior developer roles was low b/c of corporate policies that just don't mesh well with development. Nobody can get more than X% pay increase in a year, even with a promotion, etc. So if you hire a Jr at a JR salary, then they work their way up to deserving a Sr. Role, they would end up underpaid in that role.\n\nThe employee's only recourse is to switch jobs. Their manager's or director's options are limited. They aren't allowed to raise their salary to what would be reasonable. So the managers / directors eliminate those roles instead. \n\nToday people place blame on remote work, etc. That's just a convenient excuse, negligible contributing factor. The real problem hasn't changed.; This is an extremely moralistic take that plays into the game the companies are trying to play with you. I recommend not engaging, unless you're a business owner, in which case of course you'd think like that. The issue is deeper in my opinion and I'll expand a bit.\n\nI'm sure that if you spoke to any of these employees who 'job-hopped\" (which is an incorrect term that business coined to give the act a morally negative connotation, in my opinion) they'll explain to you that they got to the point where they were over-qualified for the job they were being made to do and, after working hard towards a promotion, were passed over by a less qualified colleague. I know because they won't shut up, so it's easy to see recounts in several social media platforms.\n\nThe vast majority of these people weren't opportunistic people, like the media and probably any manager you speak to will try to tell you, but people that saw that their career was being stagnated because they weren't being given opportunities and took an opportunity elsewhere. The issue is that, evidently, businesses want well trained and capable juniors but by the time they're that capable, they tend to either become seniors or change businesses because their job is not giving them the rise in work conditions that their new abilities would warrant.\n\nAnother important issue is inflation and pay rise. One common argument of people who'd change jobs often was that the businesses that trained them wouldn't raise their salaries, but would hire younger people for more money because the market was offering higher salaries, so their faithfulness to the business wasn't being reciprocated by said business.\n\nThen there's the fact that you think those extra 20k are not enough money to change jobs for. Are you aware that there's people whose yearly salary is those 20k? That's a good amount of money. If you were already living on 140k, the extra 20k will simply go to your savings. That's life changing money, there's people who do careers to win 20k more at the end of the year.\n\nBusinesses will obviously try to demonize this kind of behavior, because they want to invest as little as possible to get as much benefit as possible, but businesses aren't the only ones trying to make money, workers are as well.\n\nMore importantly, businesses were going to start raising requirements to hire developers sooner or later anyways and this is just an excuse they're giving because they're trying to asphyxiate the workers so they can pay less. Look at any other profession and you'll see that every year they require students to do more free work before they can be hired for money.\n\nIt's likely we're entering or have already entered a recession and businesses are doing what they can (and more) to lower costs to the minimum.; I think WFH killed hiring juniors more than anything else. We don’t have training programs. We don’t have proper mentors. We taught people how to be software developers by osmosis. They hung out with the other devs in a set of cubicles, and slowly learned by being next to other devs. That doesn’t happen over zoom unless you have a person on your team who is intentional about mentoring, taking away from their day job. \n\nMost companies don’t have training and mentoring for developers and admins because they do it for their sales people, their business critical people. If you’re a developer at a bank, you’re a cost center. The fact that they don’t invest in your growth is proof of that. \n\nI would say that causes the job hopping as much as the salary, and that the developer manager learns how to be a manager by fire, because they’re not training them either. We know people swap when they don’t have a great manager. ; companies destroyed the junior developer role not workers; Instead of blaming on employees job hopping, why not take a look at how did companies reward their employees to retain their pool of talents? Most are giving  employees pathetic increment that can’t even match inflation rate and laughable bonus while their top management are laughing to the bank to collect their absurd bonuses. \n\nCompanies can even cut off their employees in the name of cost savings or ‘bad headwinds’ but later announce record breaking performance and its CEO receiving a few times more bonus as compared to previous year.; The issue is that once a junior works for a company for a couple years - they now have more skills/experience and warrant more in the job market than they did first coming out of school.\n\nBut, companies don't give adequate pay increases to account for that, so juniors are generally forced to elsewhere (even promotions rarely accommodate the increased pay in the job market).  \n\nThe blame rests squarely on bad compensation policies in most corporations.  Also, most jobs don't actually offer training, it's just trial by fire - you meet the demands or you don't - and if they're using proprietary tech/tools, that's energy a developer has to spend learning something that is mostly non transferrable elsewhere.; Doesn't give out raises to keep up with market rates for current employees\n\nDoes not make room for internal growth opportunities and promotions\n\nEmployees jump to make more money doing the same thing elsewhere or to get promoted\n\n\\* surprised pikachu face \\*; Yeah it's all because we job hopped.... definitely not a result of the current state of the economy and the fact that tech companies massively over-hired when things were good.\n\nAlso, if retention is so important to companies... there is a very simple solution to this problem: Give adequate raises.\n\n> you're all showing how out of touch you are\n\nBlaming the state of the industry on job hopping lmao...; [deleted]; If you’re paying 160k for a junior dev then I could see why you’d eventually stop hiring junior devs ; No, increases in programmer supply and reductions in demand are what destroyed the junior dev role.; The disposable attitude towards loyal employees is just as much to blame.\n\nJob hopping is a two way street.\n\nOther companies are willing to pay more for top talent, and prospective job hoppers decide whether to take it.\n\nJobs are also a free market: if someone offers you a better deal, if price was the only factor and everything else was the same, of course you'd go with the better deal.\n\nLoyalty generally would make someone choose to stick with their current vendor, but if the vendor thinks you can easily be replaced, possible for cheaper, then what exactly is holding you back?\n\nEspecially when new hires are making just as much as you despite having less experience with the company.; Never providing good growth opportunities with good raises and rewards for commitment have pushed this culture first"

   "Top Comments": "Detroit used to be the world's center of automobile manufacturing, and Silicon Valley the center of semiconductor manufacturing. Eventually work goes to where costs are lower. It's taken longer for software engineering. In non-tech companies, it makes sense for developers to be near the business people, and the business people near the customers. For the tech world that is not the case. For tech, the big obstacles to offshoring have been the educational system, infrastructure, bureaucracy and time zones. Those will slowly be fixed. One thing helping right now is that China has separated itself from the rest of the world in tech. Long term, the value provided by software will increase as development tools, such as AI, make the development of more powerful software practical.; It had been seen in the past. After the shitty spaghetti code from APAC and the brilliant mind being “let go for another adventure” with his/her golden parachute, company starts to look for quality of code to be relevant again; Bc the quality from the east counties is 💀💀💀; You can always buy in talent.; Eventually the place the work is being outsourced to gets enough experience to take those senior roles too; You're out of your mind if you don't think you have to compete against outsourced talent.  Gone are the days of starting total compensation packages of 250K for new hires/grads.; Bullshit. We're stealing your jobs.; And that’s how Tesla could make it.; Manufacturing is an entirely different convo tho. Aside from supervisory staff factory work requires little skill IMO, and should require much less as factories become more automated. No one in the west wants a factory job as it’s just grunt work lots of times, but people in poorer countries are grateful for it. But ide bet that manufacturers aren’t outsourcing factory or product designers at the same rate.\n\nWhich is why I say software eng isn’t being outsourced long term atm.; Is the code quality from APAC really that bad?; Guess we just gotta ride this out until that happens!; >After the shitty spaghetti code from APAC\n\nAgreed. Same with Eastern Europe. Awful quality at best. I've worked with people from Poland and Belarus and trust me, you don't wanna work with them.; Except that 9/10 times talented people want to move to the US/Canada/Europe for a better life. Im from a 3rd world country, everyone who had the means to left including me. Thats why those countries remain unproductive, unless something crazy happens.; I’d argue that you’re borrowing them atm.; Tesla has a long way to \"make it\" manufacturing wise. To a great extent they're the inverse of auto manufacturing. \n\nIn big 3 land you often had awesome manufacturing capabilities and crap designs because of fiefdoms, supplier engineering, value added, etc. But if you wanted to build lots of shit, any big 3 plant could do it. \n\nThe newcomers like Tesla, it's the other way around. Great designs but severe lack of manufacturing know-how, or, lack of DFM/DFA/DFR experience. \n\nCompanies like Honda or Toyota... They have decent designs, good manufacturing capabilities, and a very good understanding of design to build. \n\nProof in pudding... The big 3 cut union wages from $40's to $20's and hasn't helped them. The issue was rarely manufacturing, but mostly design. \n\nToyota had a giant box of car door locks next to the door assembly station. One set of holes for power doors with or without power windows, or manual locks. The comparison big 3 door design had three different sets of holes... Assembly for each was different.\n\nAnyhow. The auto industry was fun.; Nobody wants a factory job anymore. But from what I know, factory jobs were still very common to have in the US at the time they were being outsourced. So it's not like these positions were hard to fill and they had to outsource, they chose to anyways to save money. Not different than what's happening now.; Yep. The good ones their first requirement after passing those 3 months of onboarding is to relocate them and their families to US, or EU or Canada; I can tell you from personal experience the reason they keep the seniors in us/Canada is because they are more presentable in client meetings; Yet. Luxury cars for past 30 years where all about the tech and take off. Tesla gives all that in a shitty assembly (opinion) . People will buy it. The only reason it’s not taking over is charging times.; I understand your position but I truly don't see the correlation. If we are talking about process / plant design or even factory technician jobs then I think it more comparable and I think that the statistics may not point to a massive exodus of labour. If we are talking about factory workers who do grunt work, bolting and/or aligning stuff in a factory line then I find it much more comparable with data entry roles than software dev. By that I mean, with a few months of training and a few good supervisors, you should be able to get comparable or better output from outsourced workers.\n\nSoftware Dev is not grunt work, its literally the opposite, and output is much more dependent on the quality of employees. IMO the bar is continuously moving and what was amazing work 2 years ago is an after thought today. As for AI, people keep saying that it will make engineers redundant, except that it may actually widen the gap between a poor and good engineer, as right now, a lot of the grunt work is being automated, and the grunt work is what is easily teachable. Creativity, the ability to simplify etc, those are very difficult to teach.\n\nATM the US provides better quality grads and most of the talent in other countries come to the US for better pay. I find it reasonable to say that companies are pivoting and restructuring and keeping the lights on by outsourcing \"grunt work\""

   "Top Comments": "What constitutes a \"senior\" level engineer can differ a lot between companies. It seems like you aced your interviews and they feel you are capable of performing at the level of a senior engineer in their company. Congrats on the offer! If the other aspects of the job look good to you my recommendation is to just take it; I am a mid- level dev applying for mid-senior roles. I have had some interviews where I knew most of what they were asking, but not all of them. They all ended up with “your interview went quite well, but we are looking for someone more experienced”. \nThat said, if you did so well in the interview that they decided you’d be ok for a senior position, this means that you are indeed that good (at least for what they consider a senior role). \n\nI understand that it may seem scary, so it’s up to you. I hope that you also get answers from people who have been in a similar situation.; \"Senior\" is only a word. One with a a loose cluster understandings and meanings within software circles.\n\nTurning down a higher-paying role because you are scared of that word is, I believe, ill-advised.; Take it. You’ll figure it out. Everyone has this moment.; “I got offered a bunch of money where I would learn a lot…..should I take it? I’m just not sure!”; Go for it! Seniority is not about years of experience, it is about competence and willing/capability to learn.\n\nDuring my 30 yoe, av have met many people with 10 x 1 yoe. The young engineers with 1 x 2 yoe drive in circles around these older collegues.; Just goooo.\n\nThis happened to me at 3YOE out from a 6mo bootcamp (a reputable one if there is such a thing). They needed someone who knew xamarin which is kinda obscure in my town (any town?) so they took a risk which paid off for all of us, and just like that I'm a senior.\n\nBy now you know enough to do what you need to, and if the company is decent they'll know all the stuff you're anxious about already and just guide where they need to but otherwise they should be confident in their decision.\n\nI believe in you! LFG; Would you mind sharing what kind of theoretical questions they gave you? I'm in a similar boat, mid-level interviewing for a senior position and have a technical 2nd round coming up.; Sr. Vs mid level differs from company to company. I have been in two companies so far for the past 10.5 years and I’m currently with my company for 6 years, when I joined here I had about 5.5 years of experience and a BS CS. I was brought on as a SWE II and since then been promoted to Sr. and now Lead Engineer with duties that also include mentoring new hires and interns. \n\nIn my current company Sr. Starts out at 7 YoE and a CS degree, Lead is at 10, lvl 2 is at 3. \n\nThis could very well vary at different companies.; There are other jobs.; You can reject the offer; Unless you work at companies known for their demanding work culture, such as Amazon, Meta, TikTok, and others, the title of Senior Engineer doesn’t mean much, and you shouldn’t feel too pressured. In fact, I have two senior software engineer teammates who perform worse than any non-senior software engineer in my organization. One of them doesn’t even know how to code or debug basic problems and is extremely lazy. The other is also lazy and self-centered AF, always trying to avoid any tasks she doesn’t want to do. The only aspect of Amazon’s toxic culture that I miss is how quickly they can wipeout such absolute shitty software engineers.; Titles only matter within a company. What matters between companies is responsibilities. Ask what the responsibilities of the senior job for the new role entails and see if it matches with your experience. If it doesn't, then you might be overleveled.\n\nBeing overleveled is sink or swim so up to you if you want to take the plunge.; You should see the \"seniors\" I've worked with. :|; Role levels are defined differently across companies, markets, cultures etc. interviewing is hard to assess the right level but if they did, you mostly likely fit into their definition of seniority. I wouldn’t mind accepting a challenge bigger than what I can currently do, but I’m driven by risks, so.; hey i will take this role cause i been trying for about a yr and a half now to level up to Senior, and I've been working since 2006\n\nTAKE THE GODDAMN JOB\n\nit would be apparent to them if you had Sr level skill & understanding of your domain.  It would be more apparent if you didn't.\n\nTry it. Give yourself a year to feel up to speed.; Mind if I ask what questions you didn’t know? So I can prepare myself?; I think it's reasonable to be concerned about what happens if you don't have what it takes to succeed in a higher-level role, especially in this job market (not saying the OP isn't, just in general); It was mostly testing. I don’t have enough experience in testing - I would write some unit tests on a project, then I would be moved to another were we weren’t doing any of it. By the time I would go back to a project requiring testing I wouldn’t remember anything. \nSo during one of the interviews they asked me to write a test and I didn’t remember what to do as I hadn’t written a single test for the past year…\nSome interviewers didn’t progress with me because they explicitly wanted someone to know mockito. I have never used mockito in my 5 years of working as an Android dev - telling them that I would be happy to learn it on the job wasn’t enough for them.; That's wild. I've worked with Mockito previously, but I wouldn't be able to write it off the top of my head. Seems like a really poor reason to reject a candidate."

I’m not sure any advice outside of get degree would be much help, but that also isn’t the most feasible advice; Completing a masters in CS is your best bet; Courses are good but make sure to also create decent projects to showcase your skills, even better if you can work alongside other developers to simulate real world experiences as much as possible.\n\nHonestly, everyone's best bet to a new position at any experience level is through a connection.

You have experience this time around apply to companies/ teams you are genuinely excited about and that pay well; What you actually want is discipline. Discipline to do something even when you aren't motivated to. To me motivation is near worthless.

Get to understand all the sides of the work that the university _didn't_ teach you, learn to network, _grow_ your network (but please don't just spam on LinkedIn), so that when the economy gets better you will have more options.\n\nYou live with your parent, that's good - live below your means and start saving, it will make your future _much_ easier (again, you will have more options).; Take it until you find an alternative.

Do it anyways. Accept that you won’t find satisfaction from your job, but use the money you have to make the rest of your life comfortable/rewarding. You’re not “coding 8hrs a day”, you’re “earning money for that new telescope” or whatever your hobby might be. \n\n2. Take a job in a field that is important to you. Whether it’s healthcare, government, civil rights, education, whatever. If the content of what you’re actually doing feels important to you, it feels less like “coding for 8 hrs a day” and more like “I’m building this website so that people’s lives will be better”\n\n3. Take a job with more interesting work material. Sure you may just be making the rich richer, but you also get to learn about and play with a subject material that is interesting. Again, the goal is to find something that feels more exploratory and interesting, rather than “coding 8hrs a day” you’re looking for “I get to play with robots all day” or whatever sub-field is one that seems cool to you. \n\nIf you don’t pick one of these, you will burn out hard and fast. Some people can be happy shuffling data 8 hrs a day where the only purpose is to make some assholes richer, but most normal people don’t love that. Consider prioritizing based on one of the above strategies and you’ll find it a lot easier to want to work each day.; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

   "Top Comments": "How the hell did u get a job I mean like I went back to school for it I’m 35.. no luck in even an internship; It sounds to me like focusing on improving your skills would help. Going back to school is one way to do that, but it might not be the best option. The people in this subreddit tend to act like anyone without a CS degree will never get a job in the field again, but the truth is it doesn’t matter that much- especially if you have a related degree (and MIS is related enough).\n\nOn paper getting experience will help you more than a degree. That said, knowledge matters and it seems like you need to learn and improve your fundamentals. It’s very possible to do that these days on your own by reading books and papers, watching videos, and a lot of intentional practice. It really comes down to whether or not you are good at self study. I’d suggest giving it a serious try, and augmenting self study with some online CS courses if you need a bit of direction. If you don’t feel like you’ve made a lot of progress in a year then reconsider school.; Got some downvotes but no replies, why the downvotes is this the wrong place to ask?; [removed]; I personally think we’re all 5 years away from AI taking coder jobs.

If someone were thinking about getting into the industry and asked whether they should get a degree or not, sure, I'd almost certainly tell them to go for it, but there are still plenty of good opportunities for people with experience, especially people with experience and a related degree.; [deleted]; Without a CS degree specifically, or without any degree? It's a lot more common to filter people out who don't have any degree.\n\nI don't have a CS degree (mines in CIS), and so obviously I've never worked anywhere that has a hard requirement for a CS degree. That said, I've been in the industry for almost 20 years, worked at a lot of different places in a lot of different industries. I've worked with people who don't have any college degree, people who have PhDs in CS, and people with a variety of degrees in other fields including closely related fields like EE or Math, and distantly related fields like History and Music.\n\nAcross all that experience I've just never really encountered anyone who was all that concerned with degrees for people who had experience. It's not just that people settled for non-degree holders when hiring was more difficult- even in markets like today where there's a clear advantage on the hiring side, it's just not a particularly good signal. There are too many people without degrees who are really good (even at theoretical CS) to ignore, and frankly enough people who have degrees but don't have the right skills to consider it as too much of a positive signal."

   "Top Comments": "I worked in the industry out of high school as well and looked into this back in 2020ish before deciding to go back to school full-time. I would say UoF’s online BSCS is the best right now along with ASU’s program. They’re both like T50 for CS and UoF has a solid reputation that seems to be improving nationally every year. Plus a lot of my military friends managed to get a good amount of transfer credit for random shit. I have one crazy productive friend who’s done the UoF program, done the GATech OMSCS, and is now going to a top-4 school full-time for a PhD in ML after 8-10 years in the military doing spooky cyber shit. Other programs exist but they’re basically degree mills from what I’ve seen.; > I've never really run into any issues with my lack of a degree, infact I've had it benefit me more than I've had it hurt me.\n\n\nIf this is true, why do you want a degree? In what ways was not having a degree beneficial?; Maybe consider WGU?; Go to WGU. Its competency based and fully online, and probably the cheapest/ fastest way to a degree. Having experience you will get through it fast as f. I am a recent grad and definitely recommend it; You have 5 yoe. If you had a degree, then this is about the point in your career where you would stop putting your degree on your resume and just include relevant work experience.\n\nOutside of certain jobs, most don't require a degree. If you want a degree just to have it, then nothing's stopping you. But don't think your career needs it.; Just to confirm UoF is Florida?; It's only bitten me in the ass with 1 company in the last 5 years after i got my first job. Amazon would refuse to hire me regardless of how many times Amazon recruiters assured me it wouldn't be an issue. \n\n\nAs for why I'm doing it now, layoffs are getting more common and i feel a lot more secure with a degree.; WGU does not look bad fyi, they are regionally accredited and just recently got ABET accredited as well. I have never had an issue with it, and landed a job right after graduation; I fully agree that my career doesn't need it. I haven't needed it thus far. I've only been burned by Amazon for not having it. I just want the peace of mind in case layoffs hit.; Yeah sorry for the acronyms, phone-typing. They've had their Online BSCS program I think for over 10-15 years now and a lot of people seem to like it. ASU's program is much newer. The only thing that stops some people from doing Florida's program is that you have to take Physics 1-2 and Calc 1-3 but Khan Academy will cover both of those. Definitely would recommend it considering we're leaving the wild west days of the mid 2010s where a bootcamp and some simple MERN projects could get you a job.; Oof calc 3 😭 yeah man I haven't done math in a minute. I was put on academic suspension cause I failed calc 2 twice; I'm biased as I'm literally a math and CS major now (partly why I chose to go back to school full-time) but Khan Academy + Youtube videos took me from failing AP Calculus in high school to getting straight A's in every lower-division math course from Calc 1 to Differential Equations."

   "Title": "Why is the job market so bad right now?",
   "Top Comments": "It's an oversaturated major now. And with everyone majoring in CS, why should companies need to hire only in the US? Companies now have options and can hire from countries like Mexico, Brazil, Poland, India, etc. for like a fourth of the pay (which by the standards in those nations, that's the top pay).\n\nSo basically:\n\n* Jobs leaving US at unprecedented pace post pandemic (and companies investing headquarters on those offshore countries)\n* Too many CS graduates (globally. Not even just US but globally). Insane amounts graduating each year and even more (with no ends to be) trying to be one\n* Section 174\n* Pandemic over hiring\n* Normal interest rates (past decade was an anomaly in which money was basically free to borrow)\n* Most tech companies being massively unprofitable means.... well, time to lay off\n\nWhy pay so much for an American? Pay is falling down overall for the same experience in the job market. But even then, pay outside US is just that much cheaper. And unlike the past, education is easily accessible so... US doesn't really have a monopoly in higher education like it used to in this field.; Here’s my take.\n\nThe main factor is that tech has been massively overvalued for the last decade. Investor capital has been using tech companies to shake up existing untapped markets and replace them. Like a shiny baseball bat it can bludgeon a stagnant market with. Take Uber or Doordash as an example. Did not turn a profit for a long time. \n\nWe have reached a point of consumerism where CS has solved most major needs it can address and we now have to create new markets for it to conquer. We are moving from the adoption phase into the consolidation phase. From an innovation phase to an optimization phase. Look at discord, these companies are having to seriously answer “how do we make money other than selling data?” Because increasingly the value on tech returns is proving questionable. “Are my ads really reaching consumers or bots on your platform?” “Is the data really an accurate representation or will it have become irrelevant in two months?” Having a user base and having a revenue stream are two entirely different things.\n\nIt has also meant that CS graduates have been completely divorced in most cases from the business side and have a complete lack of business sense. It’s truly incredible how many SWE lack the ability to speak to customers. We silo them away to focus on the math and logic, but most lack a fundamental understanding of product/end-user design. Some have even bragged to me about not needing to know!\n\nWe have so much tech waste as is: tons of codebases that have to be updated maintained and replaced, most devices don’t last longer than 5-10 years before we buy a brand new one. The complexity to enter the space continues to deepen and broaden. Tech is inherently an incredibly wealthy practice that for a long time relied upon people/businesses adopting it: creating web sites, buying computer networks, developing internal apps to replace paper processes, moving to the cloud etc. but that market is drying up, so tech companies continue to ask “how can I throw another stone in the pond and get some more money off the ripple?”\n\nBut the pattern is becoming obvious. The Metaverse, Apple Vision Pro, Microsoft CoPilot, the Rabbit R1: these are all things that don’t naturally fit into our lives. Like the iPhone was a natural progression from cell phones and landlines, and a fantastic innovation. The internet a natural innovation from phone lines and protocols. But now these products are asking us to adopt tech in ways that doesn’t naturally replace something, it’s only additive. \n\nPeople have been operating business with email and Microsoft office for 20 years yet for some reason they now need 16 gb of ram and a 4 core i5 just to run chrome and Outlook. They have to run QuickBooks in the cloud because…???...Intuits greedy that’s pretty much the entire reason. It’s forced obsolescence bullshit that makes me ashamed of engineering.\n\nIn my opinion there’s room in the market to undercut companies with better services that last longer. The problem is the whole sphere is dependent on massive investment. It’s nearly impossible to organically scale to compete.; Too many “SWE” not enough SWE jobs; High interest rates  \n\nOver hiring during COVID  \n\n Section 174 \n\nOver saturation  ; too many tik toks of SWE saying they dont actually work; High interest rates makes it tougher for companies to try and grow. Then in 2021 tech went absolutely fucking nuts and hired a ridiculous amount of people FAANG companies doubled in size and then 2023 they started laying people off. You add these layoffs plus less investment in new jobs and you get a shitty market. Don’t let this sub get you too down it’s not nearly as bad as some people make it seem here and this has has happened before it will reciver; Many people flooded SWE but the bubble busted. And as it is being discovered, the world never really needed much SWEs.\n\nWhat's more essential to human life is health care, manufacturing among others; I think it was a case of oversaturation. Too many people running out to boot camps and small training facilities in the hopes to land a job and now it's an employer's market for now. \n\nI also want to throw out there that interest rates are high. That means that it's a little expensive to borrow money. A lot of companies live on debt. They borrow money against assets, do what they need to do, and then pay the loan back with the profits. If something fails then they pay it with assets. \n\nIf the interest rates are really high, then it's not in their best interest to borrow money to innovate and create new things. They are better off taking their money and putting it into investments and sitting and waiting. Sitting and waiting also means they don't need people. Maybe they let go of people, or they just keep who they have but they don't hire anyone. There you go.; High interest rates + offshoring + near shoring + push for learn to code ; Because Uncle Sam took away the money printer thus forcing us to fend for \"real money\" instead [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1avadgm/comment/krfhefw/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1avadgm/comment/krfhefw/?context=3); Money printing during COVID caused slush funds with big corporations causing over hiring. That meant interest rates need to stay high for long time to digest funny money. That means less cash with tech companies for long times. That results in job cuts and less hiring. It’s economy stupid!; It's interest rates.; Too many Indians; Bad for entry people*; how many posts of this are we gonna get lol; Use the god damn search function ; It is bad only for newcomers, bootcampers and those who try to enter now for the money; I remember when I started my degree and everyone was like \"ooo the market is amazing and we need CS people\" and now I'm close to graduating and its like \"haha good luck\" 😭😭😭; Yeah all high wage english speaking countries have the disadvantage that a lot of other countries have people with decent english skills. In Europe that's not the same. Try find cheap developers that speak german, italian or danish. That's pretty much impossible and in reality in germany for example even in IT the language of working day to day for 95% of companies is german. \nBut even in europe due to the factors mentioned, it has cooled significantly.; Canada's basically unlimited foreign student policy sponsoring the diploma mills we have over here saturating our markets with foreign workers because to not allow non whites into our country is racist according to our prime minister.

Although you can also call it Systems Engineer or Software Systems Engineer for resume purposes, or “IT worker” socially; I agree about the \"IT worker\" part. To outsiders, that's all they need (and want) to know, but it certainly is vague for industrial communication.\n\nAnd, why do you think System Administrator is a good title? In fact they commonly call me sysadmin at work too. But I feel like the title itself completely ignores the SDE portion of my job. That happened before though, people don't think I also code (a lot) when I call myself a sysadmin.\n\nI usually introduce myself as a Systems Engineer, but I realize many people are not familiar with the title because of how generic it is.\n\nI also thought about DevOps, but nowadays, most people associate it with cloud automation, which is not my main line of work.\n\nI don't need a fancy title, I just need something easy for other people to quickly understand, and urggghh, it is hard.; Sysadmin also does coding though? Small scale web, database and automation work has always been part of the job especially at small non-technical orgs.; Just to double check if you think what I'm thinking. It was not mentioned in the original post, but \"coding\" that I'm referring to is a full stack development (html, css, TS, node, tooling, microservices, etc, you get the idea). It is at a small scale at non-technical org as you suggested though (web app for internal use only).\n\nIn a sense, I'm 60% SDE, 40% SysAdmin.\n\nI do agree that certain sysadmins also does coding, but more in line of bash, powershell, on-prem IaaC, or even query languages like SQL if you work on DB. (I also do these types of automation, but just a little).; Job titles are ultimately defined by the businesses and what they need done. They are more for the convenience of execs and HR types basically.\n\nYou can call your role SDE if you are applying to those types of roles. But sysadmin is a completely fine title also where you have a clear career progression path to CTO and considerably better geographic mobility and peace of mind while contributing to society. There is nothing to look down on that. If anything it’s the other way around.; Thank you for sharing, I will keep your thoughts in mind. To be honest, I don't care about the official job title, nor looking down on a specific one.\n\nI once had a conversation and people told me I'm doing jobs of multiple people of different roles. While that is technically true, the firm is small and they pay what I need. I also enjoy my line of work so I start this conversation, mainly to look for a \"keyword/title\" that can help me use in conversation and sufficiently encompass my responsibilities. That's all."

   "Top Comments": "Maybe, maybe not. It’s an internship so the bar is low. If I told you no though, would you suddenly decide to not study anything? Just do what you can in the time that you have, it’s all you can do; depends on how good of a foundation you have in computer science/other languages and things like the web/db's\n\nif you are high intermediate - advanced skill level in at least 1-2 languages, 3 weeks is more than enough\n\nif not, good luck lol, 3 weeks may not be enough to get a solid grasp. If this is the case, i'd personally start working from the ends - that is to say master the basics of python and sql then move on to learning the basics of pandas/np and how a REST api works; No. Ideally if this is too much I would wanna focus on one thing and get good at that. Maybe SQL so I can atleast have an understanding of basic syntax (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN etc...) Maybe I'd be able to atleast do some filtering, aggregating and grouping data. Maybe learn how to clean data. Or pull API requests. \n\nThis would enable me to atleast contribute to the company in some way. \n\nAnd on the side I'd keep consistently learning python and eventually reach a point after a couple months from now where I can work with python in the internship.; Also - thanks for the reply! But I'd really like to know if this sounds like a good plan. I've heard SQL isn't too hard to pick in 3-4 weeks...; Nope. I'm not an advanced level programmer (yet) ;)\n\nBut in 3 weeks I'm planning to atleast get a solid grasp of SQL as it's got a ton of applications (filtering, grouping and aggregating data). Do you think it's feasible for me to do SQL. \n\nAlso my future boss said it's only lightweight programming in terms of python and you need to know how to call APIs and everything more than actually programming (if that makes sense)\n\nSo given this - do you think 3 weeks would be enough?; SQL is easy enough to pick up the basics in a week or so. Use sqlbolt.com; That sounds great! \n\nSorry for being a bother again; but in 3 weeks, do you think I'd be able to do\n1. Learn how to API requests in Python\n2. Have an understanding on basic SQL syntax (SELECT, JOIN etc...) for filtering, aggregating and grouping data?\n3. Learn how to clean data; Probably but idk what you mean by clean data; It's really just removing duplicate data, formatting, standardising etc... But if we leave that, would it be possible?"

You'll definitely be able to get interviews no matter what your title is (as long as its technical with 'some' coding).

Here are my answers to your questions\n\n1. No. We just posted our latest roles 2 days ago and already have 423 applicants. They don't even show up on the ATS software I use to go through resumes. I'd love to meet the hiring team of any company these days who do require cover letters.\n\n2. Not unless there is a major imbalance in the supply and demand curves of labor and jobs. Since we get 423 applicants for a role these days, no need\n\n3. No\n\n4. LinkedIn is the place I recommend to everyone.\n\n5. If you aren't getting any hits on your job applications, it could be several things. I look at resumes, top to bottom. Resumes are what interest me. If its not your resume, its because you are applying to extremely competitive roles. \n\n6. OPT?\n\n7. Yes but many companies are waiting to see what happens in November\n\n8. Networking is a waste of time especially on LinkedIn. The only way networking can help is if you are networking with people who give a shit enough about you to actually do the leg work. Like will go to bat for you and sell others on you and take time out of their day for you. Even then its probably useless. \n\n9. No idea. \n\nMy two cents: I try to be as fair as possible. I am not an experience snob when sorting through resumes. I'm willing to hire those with no experience. I try to look at someone's potential in a resume and interview rather than what they have done up to this point. But at the end of the day I only have a limited amount of time to interview. Of the 423+ applicants, I am trying to short list 8 for a phone screen. I'm hoping to have a 30 minute interview with 4-5 of them. \n\nThe space is very saturated right now, especially with international/H1B candidates. I skimmed through some of the 423 resumes today and well over half of them are international/looking for sponsorship. I auto-reject those. In this market there are more than enough American citizens looking for work so I am prioritizing them. Not sure if other hiring managers/companies are doing this but I am.   \n\nI get its hard to sell yourself on a resume when you have no experience. Where are you applying for jobs? Are they in competitive markets, companies and locations? For example, if you are only applying for remote jobs, you are shit out of luck since those are ultra competitive. You think my 423 applicants for my 4 days on site role is bad? Try a remote role. Are you only applying for jobs in a market with a large talented labor pool like the Bay Area or NYC? You are shit out of luck. I'll give you the advice I gave someone else earlier. Try looking for on site roles in small markets where the local talent pool is not going to be as competitive. My first job in this space was in Eastern Iowa. Less competition for DS roles in states/locations like that. Also look for peripheral roles. You may not land a role as a DATA SCIENTIST. But look for job titles like data analyst, research analyst, business analyst, etc. as these roles may not be called DATA SCIENTIST but they have a lot of overlap and can get you experience that will help you land a DS role in the future.; [removed]; This page has some pretty good information: [https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/job-market-tougher-than-it-looks-5915841/](https://www.linkedin.com/news/story/job-market-tougher-than-it-looks-5915841/) One suggestion is to do networking by commenting on posts to get yourself known.

   "Top Comments": "[deleted]; It’s a highly competitive market at the moment so if you don’t have education/projects/internships that make you stand out from the crowd, it can be tough to get your foot in the door.\n\nThe days of graduating CS and just walking into a job are gone. I would be applying for grad roles, and be working on a project that has real world value. Data Migration, ERP software, things that you can point at as having actual relevance towards a job / industry you are applying for. Government is a good one. Lots of opportunity in that space.; I don't know. I'm in the same situation.; I feel the same way. Exact same degree and rough time frame. I had family obligations over summer so internships were out of question over summer the only plus side to that was no college debt for that sacrifice. I’ve been applying the past 6-7 months and the jobs have significantly dried up to even apply for the past few weeks. My area had 10 just 10 job postings the entire last week for entry level IT, analyst, software engineer in a city with a population of a million and fast growing.; Consider grad school. This isn’t a great time to get into the market, but it will probably recover over time. If you can get into a phd program you will have a (low) stipend and gain more experience, and then can do a job search at a future date.; Probably look into government work if you can pass clearance checks or move to any place that will be in office and wants you. \n\nEpic the medical company always seems to be hiring too.\n\nAlso look into SDET, QA or help desk but realize your coding skills will degrade if you don't use them. \n\nData annotation tech is another company to look into.; If you’re a US citizen, I would seriously recommend you to focus on Data structure and algorithms and solve a lot of leetcode problems for a while. Go full on prep mode for 3-4 months. Trust me there are new grad openings at big tech and if you’re are able to clear the technical coding round you’ll get it, the companies wont have to go through the hassle of sponsorship which gives you a lot of advantage.; Have you connected with your (former) professors in search of networking connections? They typically are well connected to local CS employers and can really help your search. Networking is the only way to stand out in this crowded job market.; Sounds like you're at a really tough stage, you are not alone. \n\nDon't lose faith in yourself, or in the tech industry.\n\nThere's a role out there for you, you just have to have persistence to keep firing off the applications and a shit load of luck to have it land on the right desk at the right time.\n\nRejection is horrible, but keep the faith, it will pay off soon. Good luck; 'i just had an interview with a startup and I was told im not what they're looking for. at what point do you become what they're fucking looking for? what was the point of my degree?'\n\nYa I get this new type of rejection emails saying that I am not the type they are looking for but I have an interesting profile, then fucking hire me. Dont sugarcoat it. Or just say NO and send me.; The fastest way to get hired is to find a staffing agency in your area and let them apply to thousands of places. They usually find the shittiest jobs available, but treat them as a \"long post grad internship\". Until you get 3 years of experience AND a bunch of cloud certs, it is very hard to stand out. \n\nAdditionally, do leetcode non-stop for 2-3 months.; The ideal path is to find a small company. Don't let people recommending big tech to you fool you. It's not worth it. Find a boring company like insurance or healthcare and become part of their dev team. You apply at least 10 jobs per day.\n\nYou need to network and be sociable. CHA is completely OP right now in engineering. Small boring companies would rather have a personable dummy than genius asshat.; Did you make any relevant connections in school? Classmates who found jobs and can refer you past the resume filter? Professors or TA's who have industry connections and can refer you? Internship(s) where you can work old coworkers for a connection and referral?; Did you do an internship? That’s the easiest way to get an offer; I completely understand how you feel. I also had to take 2 extra years because of my illness, and feel extremely bitter that I graduated into such a shit market; go to code meetups in your local city or area if its possible. in person is best but theres also communities on places like discord. being part of a group, collaborating on projects and supporting each other can be helpful for staying positive.\n\nnetworking skills are extremely valuable and shaking hands or having a beer with the right person can make all the difference.\n\nthe bar for getting that first job, maintaining the current job, and/or obtaining the next job has risen for most of us.\n\nbtw what skills and projects are you listing on your resume?; Gotta up skill bruh. The bars are set higher now. Degree means jack poop if you have no projects to show off, or if you can’t even talk about how to develop applications; It’s a competitive market. I wouldn’t wanna be graduating right now without an internship and too tier grades. People def care about that starting out but care less further in your career. \n\nI’d say look at big cities to move to and be open to moving.; Talk to everybody you know who works in/ adjacent to the industry. Ask them what it’s going to take to work on the kind of teams you’re interested in. work for free if you have to. You have to use your connections in this market. I quit my job 2 years ago to pursue software development and have been working shit internships and contracting jobs and just got a full time offer with a very respectable company. I’m fully self taught, it can be done. \n\nAnd also, the market is only “over saturated” with people that WANT to work in software development but have zero experience.

They may not even pull it right away, if you remember summer 2022, a lot of  companies (big ones too) rescinded new grad offers.

If someone asks \"what do we need more, more farmers or more teachers\", that question doesn't become invalid only because the two jobs in comparison are totally different.\n\nAlso yes I agree, chasing the hot trend doesn't make sense, but it's not about what I should chase but rather just a curiosity with regards to what people think might help technology advance better.; I am aware that the 2 are totally different, but I don't understand why that's a problem. If someone asks \"what do we need more, more farmers or more teachers\", that question doesn't become invalid only because the two jobs in comparison are totally different; Because software engineers build everything for the most part. Is the AI researcher going to fix/build websites, applications, video games, etc?; My point is that you can't just have more of one of them. It's supply limited, there are a very limited number of people that can do it. As a hypothetical not bounded by anything, sure get some more AI researchers.\n\nDo you want more Ferraris in your garage or Hondas? Sure, it's a question, just don't see how it's all that interesting of one.; There are quite a few people from my university who graduated with a computer science degree and wonder whether to go for a PhD in AI or take up a software dev job. Most of them go for the latter since it seems to make more money, but I wanted to know what would be better to choose in terms of purely looking at what might make a bigger impact in the long run; What I'm explaining is that it isn't really a choice that's actually available to people. Actual, employable AI researchers are paid a lot lot more than engineers. \n\nIt's just that 0.1% of the people that start at the fork you're talking about end up being AI researchers. Software is a much less risky direction to choose, overall.; Okay that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification"

And the market isn’t getting better any time soon with the huge influx of outsourcing to developing countries. Don’t go into CS, you aren’t going to find a job at the moment.; You can also consider a masters in computer science like omscs or mscso.; Is a nursing program like CRNA or MS / APN out of the question?; [removed]; CS is cooked. Stay in RN; It's funny because I am switching to nursing. I have a computer science degree with only a year of experience. Got laid off Aug 2022 and have not found any job yet. I got burnt out from job hunting, self-studying and currently working at a grocery store. It's been almost two years and I feel defeated so I give up. \n\nMy priority at this point is job security. Currently waiting and hoping to get accepted in a nursing school which will only take me 2 years since I also have a biomedical science degree.\n\nI also want to say that there are devs out there with lots of education and experience having troubles getting reemployed. \n\nHowever, I would say to STILL GO FOR IT if you're passionate about it. Software development is fun! I don't think it hurts since you can always fall back on nursing. Just beware of the very hard competition and the grind to get employment.\n \nI will also be going back to tech once I make myself recession-proof as a nurse! I love software development so much but I am so traumatized by long-term unemployment, job and financial insecurity. So goodbye tech for now.  \n\nI may be pursuing clinical informatics in the future. Who knows. But it does not sound interesting to me. Would likely go back as a software developer.\n\nGood luck on your journey!; I am in the same boat as you, reality is you can have a degree from anywhere and it will be hard to land a first job. I’ve thought about it though and in reality all we need is a degree and an opportunity, we have good jobs that pay us well and there are schools like WGU that are relatively cheap and reputable that would practically make no impact to our financial well being so I figured I’d shoot my shot. I enjoy CS in general but ended up in engineering so I’m getting the degree just to get it. If I land a job great if not that’s okay too maybe I’ll get a masters or something after. But the skills will be extremely important especially in the future. Also don’t limit yourself to being a DEV and a lot more opportunities will open up for you.; Good luck.  IT/SWE market is complete garbage right now.  Also consider that we don't know how AI is going to impact the IT/SWE field over the next 5-10 years.  According to Elon Musk, most software jobs will probably be eliminated.; Unrelated but knees over toes guy helped me with injury. Has stuff for the back; Yea, I don't plan to quite my nursing job until I have another one lined up. And I would be part time at the minimum if I enrolled in a degree program for CS. When you say management, wouldn't that require a masters?; Hey, thanks for your honesty! All the job markets seem pretty terrible as of late :'(; Thanks! I'll check these out. I was hesitant to look into a MS since I don't have a true math/CS/engineering background.; I'm not interested in staying for direct patient care. CRNA requires me to move back to ICU (hated that, there were a lot of ethical dilemmas that lead to a tone of morale trauma). APRN would require 20k+ tuition for approximately similar pay in my area since it's so oversaturated. Higher pay for APRN would be inpatient, and that's just not a level of responsibility I'm wanting for the pisspoor education most NP programs provide.; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

Not their fault, it’s just the nature of the beast. ; Yea, I almost agree that it's feeling like a shoot your shot type of situation. Which is unfortuante because that's how I went to nursing school. But, I don't think I can stay in nursing for another 5 years in either an outpatient or inpatient capacity. \n\nI also thought about getting a ms later if degrees are really that important, it just seems like every job is pretty sucky but I would really like to break out of this nursing pothole I put myself in. I definitely don't plan to limit myself to dev roles when I apply. Another reason why I'm considering a BSCS vs a masters in data science or something more specific.; Can you give me a reference where Elon Musk has mentioned that most software jobs will probably be eliminated.; I dont think so, some IT managers dont have any degree. At least for my local government. \n\nIm just trying to say, work with the IT team as a nurse or administrator that way you can land a stable software job.\n\nOnce you get your degree.\n\nOutside of that, you are going to face millions of younger smarter cheaper candidates. ; Hey there. I’m a PA from Midwest(although I’m now in a more data related role). All due respect, but don’t listen to comment above. I’m in WGU right now(starting 2nd Masters at OMSCS in Fall), and if you’re self-motivated(which most of us healthcare folks are), it’s a good option.\n\nWith your background, a career in health data is a definite possibility. I’ve spoken to countless RPH/APR /MD/PhDs who are also SWE/MLEs, and we all agree that our healthcare background was more important than coding skills. Coding skills can be learned, online if necessary. Having the underlying clinical expertise is huge, and a SWE cannot just “pick-up” those skills. I think the market for us will be huge in the next few years.\n\nEDIT: And yes, WGU is a great alternative to even the best bootcamp. If you want to work with data, you’re going to want a more solid/well-rounded background. If you just want to be a web dev(not great timing), you might not need those things."

But getting that role can involve a lot of networking and/or politics+nepotism ; Something in systems management or cybersecurity probably. Basically you’re an environment wiz and don’t have to follow dumb sprint cycles.; The easiest CS job is being at the start of a very successful startup, then after several years you are the guy that knows everything in and out because you were the sole developer from the beginning and they can't afford to lose your domain knowledge. But that's just luck if the startup succeeds or not.; scrum master; Prob being on a team that’s good at looking busy, solving easy problema; QA testing, agile coach, low/no-code tool dev; I mean, \"easy\" is pretty subjective.

Some people I know make it look so easy it's crazy.\n\nPretty much, it's going to be whatever you actually like doing, and seem to have innate ability/talent for.\n\nMaking .NET Core web applications with C#, JS and SQL feels crazy easy to me, but some people would hard disagree with that sentiment.\n\nAs far as what work requires the least effort?

Whenever I feel blocked in one ticket, I either need a break or some other ticket to divert my mind otherwise I keep getting similar ideas and nothing out of the box; At my previous workplaces, we worked in 2-week sprints, so we were assigned a number of tickets to finish in a sprint. You can work on any of them at any time during the sprint, but some were higher priority\n\nAlso, there were sometimes urgent bug fix tickets that could emerge that needed immediate attention; Uhhh, yeah, quite a few...; I've probably got 4 or 5 on me at all times. 2 yoe; I prefer to have more than one ticket on the go so when i hit a wall with one I can feel productive while I let my brain mull over whatever made me take pause with the other.; Sometimes, but I always seem to get more right away.  I usually have 2 or more and also work on unticketed items that just need to be fixed/solved immediately.; Each sprint we get points and I get a number of tickets to fill that. Usually 3 tickets sometimes 5. Rarely less than 3. If you have one ticket, it means that one ticket is too big and should be split up into smaller tasks.; I have 2-3 ongoing projects at any time, each with multiple tickets at any given time.; Yeah, pretty much always.; I've got 150 tickets assigned right now, got that down from 310 over the last few months (over half by closing as obsolete or unassigning myself); Only time when I am truly working on only a single task is when shit hits the fan and the service is failing and needs a resolution ASAP.; Started the sprint with three tickets in development. Two will deploy to non-prod on Monday (8 points total). I’m still considering one. I have like six or so in the queue.; I think the only times I had a single ticket was when I was an intern. Even then that didn't last for very long.; Ideally, yes. You have 1 main thing you're working on because a human can only do one thing at a time. On the other hand, you might get blocked on that one thing, so it's good to have the next task on your plate for when that happens. So 2 tickets is good.; Like 200 feature tickets 100 awaiting review 300 in backlog (never to be done) and then 50 undocumented tasks; All the tickets, until you become the owner of the queue, then you assign them all to someone else.\n\nCircle of life.; I don't even know who handles 1 ticket at a time.; Usually I have about 10-20 tickets assigned to me at any given point in time."

   "Title": "Would you accept a dry promotion?",
   "Top Comments": "I did once. I used it in a job interview I had scheduled that same day.; Only if I'd already been doing the work of the role I'm being promoted to, and then only so that I'm able to use it in my resume.; Only if the promotion is a recognition of my increased experience and just involves me continuing to do what I've been doing. \n\nIf it's a promotion to lead engineer or manager, then I'd reject it. That's a lot of new responsibility. I'd expect a raise.; I’ve found that for IC promotions, you’re almost certainly already doing the work for upwards of 6+ months before the promotion anyways.\n\nSo, yes, but I would keep my options open for an external move.; In the right environment it can be a very effective (but stressful) strategy to accumulate a very large amount of ownership at one place while keeping friction on them as low as possible to push that forward quickly, if they will just keep letting you grab more and more control. Then you can use that experience and title to transfer to somewhere that will pay market rate for someone who has demonstrated that they can handle that broader set of responsibilities if (probably when) they don't fix their positioning to reflect your leverage. Or, if they're competent, they might realize that you have them by the balls and they need to make sure you stay happy and the person that runs everything doesn't leave. They're probably incompetent given they aren't giving the raise so just plan on leaving once you establish your footing as high as you can to jump. Either way it can work as a ladder so long as you really succeed at carrying the weight and can demonstrate that fact externally. The external company doesn't have to know that you weren't paid appropriately when jumping, you just tell them exactly what you did with the results which is all that matters, so can get a pretty sharp increase if played right.;  I would if it put me into a higher pay-band. If I go from top of the L5 pay band to the bottom of the L6, that leaves a lot more room for raises (and makes them a lot easier to get); Yes, the position is a widely known and not some internal \"Level 2 engineer\" or \"BC5 software expert\" that no one outside your company understands as those will not make sense to others.  For example, \"Lead\" or \"Manager\" or \"Supervisor\" or \"Staff\" or \"Senior\" are widely known and understood without any explanation.\n\nTitle matters when it makes sense to the interviewer, and you can back up that title with examples of what qualifies you for it.; Normally, no, but there may be special circumstances.; Yeah, take it. Title bumps go a long way for future jobs.; I would try to negotiate first. See if they are willing to budge. Then, while they are in the midst of deciding on whether or not to give you a raise, start looking for other jobs because they have shown they do not respect you.\n\nBut basically, there is likely no harm in kindly asking for a raise. If you get the raise, you get the raise. If you don't, then accept the promotion regardless and start applying elsewhere. For example, if you are a software engineer and get \"promoted\" to senior software engineer, you will likely be able to start with that title at a different company. Most companies will respect your current title (unless it's something dumb like \"Senior Distinguished Engineer” when you have 1 YOE). That may boost your starting salary by $10,000 or more.; More responsibilities for the same remuneration? No thanks. I’ve done the opposite tho, went from Lead to Senior for more money.; It’s a great thing to add to your resume that you use when applying to new jobs immediately after; I have. It was early in the pandemic.\n\nPaid off well a year later.; If you’re planning to leave it can beef up your resume.; Only if I intend to stay at the current company for say like 2 years and then bounce. \n\nGetting the promotion is great but if you get the promotion and try looking for that role in a different company in 2 months they maybe hesistant. But if you keep  the role for 2 years shows staying power.\n\nPlus in 2 years the pay raise will be insane cause more than likely you are getting yearly pay raise of what like 5% at current job that's with current salary in 2 years you can probably get like 20%+ pay raise.; I would if it was CTO or something I could obviously parlay into other good job opportunities shortly thereafter.; I would if it was CTO or something I could obviously parlay into other good job opportunities shortly thereafter.; I like it wet; Futurama did an episode on this.; Yes, I just did, moving from delivery manager (8 teams) to enterprise architect. \n\nI’m pretty sure I can and will cash out with this in a year or two."

It's not a good, nor a bad practice. It just is.; It's meant to convey a softer, \"to be continued\" type of vibe than ending a sentence with a period.; I can't speak to everyone, but as a younger person it always comes off as passive aggressive when it's used in a professional setting. Sometimes it's used when people are thinking about something. However, when someone goes 'Okay...' it seems like they're having a bad attitude.; Rajesh please do the needful...; If they're Indian, the ellipsis is considered a softer way to end a message than a period. I think their native language has an equivalent concept; Indicates a pause in speech, and could mean different things depending on context.  \n\n\"...what?\" means whatever you just typed was astonishingly unexpected.  i.e. could mean you asked a stupid question, or could mean you reported some really weird bug, etc.\n\n\"All you have to do is click this button, then restart the server....\" indicates impatience that they're having to explain this to you.\n\n\"Checking...\", \"Hmm....\" etc usually indicate the person is thinking about it and is about to write up a more detailed response.  It's a quick way to let you know they're on it, but it's going to take work to get the answer.\n\nJust \"...\" by itself?  Again depending on context that could be the same as \"Hmm...\" or it could be \"i asked you a question and am still waiting for an answer.  It's been long enough that I'm growing impatient and irritated that you haven't replied yet\"; I do this a lot as well... I think it conveys a human element (pausing, considering).; I do it a lot. It's generally meant to convey analytical thinking, ponderousness, etc, for me. But I can see how it could be taken as questioning or passive aggressive in a lot of contexts.; I've accepted it is a cultural difference from those who never experienced an AIM chatroom in their formative years. Typing an ellipsis is more characters than a single period so I always see it as \"more work\" (even though it's less than a second). Plus, I don't feel written text needs to be an exact transcription of how I would speak in a conversation. It's fine to not include my pauses and filler words like \"um\". It's fine to be more succinct in my typing than my speaking. This is also why I never just type \"hello\" and just wait to start off a work chat. I'm polite in my written messages, but will simply write 2+ sentences so that I get to the point all at once.; As others have noted the conversational portion if the person is sending code snippets back and you have something like code snippet … code snippet, then they are just omitting what is not important or unchanged; When one of my old bosses in the industry typed this, I knew I was in hot water. He used it as a response to my questions and usually it meant \"How tf do you not know the answer to this already?\"; I like to call those boomer dots.\n\nEspecially when they’re used…\n\nlike this… \n\n*feather blows away in the wind*; It’s just… a way to talk…; I sort of have fallen into the trap of using this as well, with the intent of \"to be continued...\" kinda.\n\nEllipses at the beginning of a response imo is definitely in the passive aggressive realm, less so at the end of a response (but I do see how others would, depending on context).\n\nNow instead to convey consideration I just use 'hmm' at the beginning of the sentence or message lol it probably drives people crazy but imo leaves less room to interpret my messages as passive aggressive.; I use the spinning thinking emoji.🤔 but 3d spanning.; I was told it’s a generational thing, and that matches with my experience. People currently aged maybe 45-60.\n\nI pointed it out at a prior job informally and (of course) all my coworkers then started including it in ALL of their messages just to spite me. Some of them still do it in their “happy birthday” messages to me on Facebook. Heh.\n\nBut yes—the ellipsis does have a meaning that is easily googleable. It’s just commonly included (without any intended meaning) by people of a specific generation.; I think people use it to give the impression of “I paused here to think” but I personally hate it. It almost always can be interpreted as condescension.; It is a crutch for dumb people who don't know if they should use a period or a comma.; Several years ago I always thought this was a sign a manager was upset with something.

They want someone who can do a senior level job for entry level pay and do the contract to hire to make sure you will go above and beyond to do it. You dodged a bullet IMO; Just wait till Monday.\n\nThere’s a saying, if you can’t handle the heat, stay out of the kitchen.\n\nNegotiate when you have leverage, when you don’t have leverage, then it’s a tossup.; I don’t understand why the lower end of that range would be an issue if still within the range that they’ve provided? Like they should be okay with what you require, considering they love you, up to 50/hr, right? I’d reply, “if you truly love me, why don’t I feel loved?”; It’s possible the 30-50 range was dependent on experience. \n\nAt 3 YOE maybe they placed you towards lower end. \n\nI wouldn’t panic, hold and I bet they might meet you halfway between both numbers.; Do you get benefits in the contract role? 3 months without healthcare or paying for it is EXPENSIVE.; What was the purpose of switching? Seems like the exact same pay with less job stability\n\nThat said, I think $44-50/hr is quite low and well in the realm of reasonable for 3YOE. You shouldn’t feel bad for negotiating, especially if you passed their interviews and it’s contract work — they need to bump up the pay because of the inherent risk; Ft to contract for 3k more? Are Y you insane?; This sounds like the company just wanted the absolute minimum they could get you for. Not a good sign when they \"loved you.\" If they love you as a contract position then a few extra per hour isn't important.\n\n3 years of experience is still early yet and the labor market for junior levels isn't great right now. If you are patient you will see a solid offer eventually.; This is not an upgrade. I repeat this is not an upgrade. You’re not guaranteed an FTE role after this 3 months are up. Unless you’re doing OE this really isn’t worth the hassle. Just be patient.; What is this contract-to-hire business. Why not just a standard probation period?\n\nAnd what are the conditions on this contract? How does the contract rate affect the final offer if at all?\n\nLike - why can't they say - oh we paid you $44 on contract, we'll offer you $33 full time with x amount time of, and these benefits as well as RRSP matching and tiny fraction of equity?; if ur not willing to walk away dont negotiate, the strongest leverage in a negotiation is the willingness to walk away.; 3k for contract? Eh... I wouldn't say it's worth switching. It need to offer a whole lot more if it's not full-time.; If you “need” something then you have no room to negotiate."

If your team takes forever to do them, then maybe they will reassign them to another team. It seems your team has been more efficient doing those tasks then others, so you get rewarded with doing more of them.; 1) You could always lose the job sticking up and doing the right thing if you have enough garbage on your team.  The nail that sticks out gets hammered.  \n2) You do you, be the best dev you can be.; Leadership talk is very different from leadership action. Most leaders are excellent liars.

It’s never the same thing twice and always a new challenge every day. \n\nAnd if that is what YOU want to do then keep doing what you’re doing. \n\nIf you’re unhappy with your role or your team’s role then YOU need to speak louder and be the one to lead the team to where you want to be OR if you’re not wanting to be in that leadership role then find another role/team/manager/company. \n\nDespite any loyalties you have to your team you need to look out for yourself first. \n\nHow do you get “punished for it in some way ?”\n\nGenerally you never should just be a yes man. I was a yes man for years and it just made my work miserable. Always over worked and never completed anything on time or with good quality. \n\nI’ve improved over the years and discovered that being willing to say NO with experience and evidence behind it will make one’s career go further. \n\nBut the freedom to  speaking your mind comes with risks and challenges. \n\nNever make it sound like you’re complaining. Have evidence as to why you are saying no. Have a suggestion as to alternatives.  Site your experience or the experience of others. Try to be insightful as to the requests you are getting and the process as a whole.   Look for ways to reduce pain points (Devops) and use your experience with finding others people bugs to suggest improvements to make your team’s work unnecessary.  This kind of added value is what can make you go far.; I've tried that. In the team health checks, there's a \"I feel free to share my thoughts\" survey question, and I anonymously rated this one low. The meeting host asked, \"Would someone like to add to this and say why they don't feel free to speak?\"\n\nNo one spoke, so they moved on to the next item\n\nWe have our retrospective today. I'm going to stay quiet.; It's definitely a strange situation. I have people in leadership on the team telling me privately that they appreciate it that I speak up and that we need my voice on the team. Those same leaders  will watch me get hammered and even sometimes do the hammering.; As far as \"punishment\" goes, the lead asked me to merge a PR, and I did. My boss then threatened publicly to revoke my merge privileges because I didn't go through the normal process. After the meeting, I showed him the Slack message where the lead told me to merge the PR, and my boss said, \"Yeah, but he didn't mean that.\" When I asked, \"How does 'Merge this PR'' mean something different?\", my boss responded with \"I agree, the comms weren't great.\"\n\nOr, my boss will ask for my technical opinion in our 1:1, and then agree with my opinion. He'll either steal the idea and take the credit for himself, or he'll bash my idea in public, pretend to agree with the lead, and then slowly act like my idea became his idea. I had a 1:1 with him once where he completely agreed with my idea. We immediately went into a public meeting after my 1:1 where he and the lead bashed my idea. I finally said, \"I don't agree with what either of you are saying, but I'll go along with it.\"\nAs soon as I said that, instead of bashing my idea, my boss started back pedalling and saying, \"Wait a minute. Why are you giving up so easily? Maybe your idea is good. You're making no sense.\"\n\nWe ended up going with my idea.\n\nThis has happened repeatedly. My boss has the title of \"Architect\", but which is one of the highest technical titles in our company, but he is technically incompetent. The lead often comes up with technical ideas that are wrong and many times dangerous. More than once, I've saved us from going over a cliff. My boss has asked me to keep doing this. He wants me to disagree with the lead whenever the lead is wrong, because my boss doesn't know any different. But publicly, he either steals my ideas as his own or pretends to side with the lead to make him happy. \n\nIt's a bad place to be. My lead wants me to be a \"Yes man\". My boss doesn't want me to be a \"Yes man\" because he's technically incompetent and I've saved the team multiple times. \n\nI fear that if I become a \"Yes man\", eventually we are going to go over the cliff and my boss would say, \"You're senior to the lead. How did you not see this coming? Why didn't you say anything?\"\n\nI've definitely made the mistake of complaining at times. Thank you for that. I'm going to try and stop doing that.; A beautiful irony, thanks for giving me a laugh; If they ask again, say “maybe because that person didn’t want to be singled out like in this meeting right now?

I got into a yelling match with the software lead in scrum this past Monday and called him an expletive. I made a public apology yesterday, and he made one today.

He's a very nice person and easy to work with. I only wanted to know if we should allocate time for reviewing tech specs because it sometimes takes a long time to do so, and I wanted to know if there was some way we could link this to the producer's efficiency report; This isn't supposed to be funny, but it made me laugh, and it's the absolute truth. No one is speaking on the team but me now.; This is where I struggle the most.

The rules are very muddy, and they tend to change.\n\nI'm sure that there are cases where if I don't speak up, I will get in trouble with leadership saying, \"You were a high level engineer that didn't call out this design flaw and should have, even though you're not the lead, and if you called it out, you would likely be punished\"\n\nI've been looking for two years for a job that pays as much as this one, but so far I haven't been able to get an offer. I'd be willing to take a pay cut for a better work environment, but there are definitely limits on how much of a cut I can take.

Placing bootcamp credentials in there just adds unnecessary dirt to your resume. In fact, I would say it makes your resume worse.;  Like others, The first thing I noticed was you mentioning your bootcamp first then math degree. No one cares about the bootcamp. The math degree coupled with experience is enough.; Yes, remove the boot camp. ; Upvoting because I'm in a similar position - would appreciate responses; Why is everyone saying take off bootcamp? What’s wrong with it?\n\nI agree that having bootcamp only on your resume may not be sufficient in today’s market but I wouldn’t think keeping it on the resume along with a math degree + some YOE is bad.; Why did you go to a bootcamp with a math degree…; Absolutely keep the bootcamp in your resume idk wtf everyone else is on about. Leaving it off when looking for software work is ridiculous.; Adding \"boot camp\" on a resume with a math degree on it, is as if you smeared the resume with feces before handing it to the recruiter.; I would leave the bootcamp off your resume. A BA in Mathematics is already very valuable right now of itself because of the trending in AI and Big Data/Analytics in everything. Plus, you already have experience in this industry.\n\nOf course it all comes down to personal preference, but if it was me, I would imagine this: All of your tech YOE and the Math/STEM degree are food from 3-stars Michelin restaurants… Would you present them with something like a Big Mac from McDonald altogether on the same table?; I’m in the same exact position, same degree, same timeline, same yoe. It’s crazy that people are recommending removing boot camp from the resume, although I have considered it before because I am not getting any interviews. My boot camp was 6 months long though and if I leave it out I fear it makes me look like I have a big gap between graduating with my math degree and getting my first dev job.; You need to think like a recruiter. They tend to think in terms of slimming down the resume pile starting with quick rules of thumb and more elaborate reading on later iterations. \n\nSo having boot camp mentioned can get OP slated into the “entry level career switcher” pile on an early pass while leaving it out will avoid triggering that filter and allow OP’s resume to make it through “meets the education minimum” and into the “possibly relevant industry experience” pile; It's weird, isn't it? I'd say that it's complementary to a math degree.\n\nTBH, there are plenty of CS graduates who would benefit from picking up some real-world skills in a bootcamp.; I felt like I had a very solid grasp on coding fundamentals but wasn't necessarily job ready with what I had learned in school. I didn't know much about web development or any of the skills I've been using professionally like web frameworks. Also because it was a math degree I didn't take a lot of hardcore software dev courses. It was classes stuff like algorithms and data structures.; If OP keeps their resume to a page (which is standard for US), space comes at a premium, and someone with 3.5 YoE as a SWE will almost assuredly have 2 more bullet points of impact they can list over mentioning the bootcamp. ; What about someone without a STEM degree? I've got 4 YOE after a boot camp but originally just had a business degree. Would you leave the boot camp out still?\n\n\nEdit: typo, without not with; Coding bootcamp grads are trash… you learned basic frontend dev for the price of a college education. I believe advanced math to be much harder than CS courses. Doesn’t matter now though I guess. I might even take it off the resume unless it was a top bootcamp or something; It’s harder to say. If they are particular about the degree type you might get filtered out either way, and if they are not, having experience already makes it redundant anyway.\n\nSo it‘s a hit or miss: is the resume screener more likely to be positive or negative towards bootcamps? And would they even see it if it is at the bottom of your resume below all the more relevant stuff?; I don't disagree that coding bootcamps are not sufficient to learn how to code and be job ready in 3 months. And I'm saying this as a bootcamp grad lol. Back when I did it in 2019 bootcamps were sill riding the high of actually being a somewhat viable way to enter the industry. Again though, I didn't take the bootcamp going in cold - I knew a lot about coding before hand and it was a good way for me personally to learn certain skills relevant to the industry. Perhaps it was unnecessary and not a good use of money but at the time it felt like the right decision for me. In any case that was almost 5 years ago and whats done is done.; When I say bootcampers are trash I mean the ones w/o STEM degrees. You probably got the equivalent of 6 mo. exp at a frontend oriented dev role. You will be fine bc of your math degree, likely already made back the loss. I would remove the bootcamp, and stop focusing on frontend if your resume is built that way."

   "Top Comments": "It's not weird to feel that way. But just know that what you're looking for is quite rare (super fulfilling work, you're not seen as a resource, using a rare skillset that you have for yourself and you're unlikely to be ever laid off).\n\nIn the end, for the vast majority of companies you'll always be a resource. And that's not unique to this industry, it's just how it is as a fundamental concept. You have to accept that a business exists to make money. And the highest cost for a company is typically people. Running a business is an orchestration of many things, and that includes getting people to do what you need for the company to make money and continue operating. So the overwhelming majority of jobs, you'll always be a resource. Even if you're really good at what you do, you bring a ton of value to the company, you'll never be truly safe from being seen a disposable resource. You can make that decision difficult, but it'll never go away. Then there's the whole concept of always pushing for more growth. And a lot of businesses will do what it takes to make shareholder or investors happy, and that's seldomly in the best interest of their average employee.\n\nIn my opinion, your best approach is to find a way to accept this, and find a job that you enjoy and always be prepared for the worst. You can also make it a little better for yourself. Because you can see patterns where the bigger the corporation, the more likely you'll just be a resource, but some smaller companies have less of that mindset, but it never truly goes away.\n\nThere are jobs out there where you can enjoy doing what you do, and you can work there for many years.  There are simple just pros/cons to all things, and you have to accept the cons. For example, I've had 3 jobs in 20 years, and they've mostly been smaller to medium sizes software companies with a cool culture that actually value people. I don't always work on the most innovative things, but I'm happy, valued, and make good money with cool people. I've seen rounds of layoffs, but typically it's the low performers that get laid off.\n\n>i want to have a rarely found skillset...\n\nThis is a double-edged sword.  This won't make you indispensable. It'll make it harder for you to find a job if your skills are too niche, but you'll likely have less competition. But the problem of being a resource will still exist. And if it's too niche, you may find that the niche goes away over time and you could end up having a skill that's no longer in demand.\n\n>i want the things i work on to have meaning\n\nIt depends on what this means for you in the end. These kinds of jobs exist. But just know that this doesn't always mean a better quality of life. My best friend got a dream job in a green energy company, something she has a major in outside of her CS major, and she was thrilled to finally align her passions. However, the environment and culture were toxic. She ended up leaving a year later and she works for a company that has a culture where she's happy, even if the context isn't as inspiring.; okay thank you but maybe i did not explain well - i do know it is unrealistic to be like they can never get rid of me i won't be a resource etc\n\ni just meant like i want to be one of those engineers that they advertised to us when we were applying to colleges in high school. engineering is to build towards humanity's advancements isn't it? what have i done so far? just helped banks torture the people indebted to them more efficiently... \n\ni want like a healthy balance here of course. i know i won't invent the next quantum computer. i just wanted to ask about an area of computer science i can focus towards that would get me a job where i could build more meaningful things. i'm not saying i don't ever want to be a resource, i'm saying i don't want to be a resource to the kind of companies i mentioned. a company with a vision instead of just some cheap software with the always same building practices, i would love to be a resource to.; That makes sense. Then there's more opportunities out there. It depends on your perspective though. For example, I worked at a company that built a locator software with deep analytics and integrations. Depending on your perspective, that may or may not bring meaning to the world. I personally saw it as I was helping connect people who were looking to buy something to find the best place to buy it, and at times giving them coupons/discounts along the way. But you could just as easily look at it like it's just another machine to make a company money.\n\nPart of it will be the companies you go after, part will depend on your outlook and perspective on things."

The difference between intrinsic and extrinsic (external) motivators.\n\nThe thing is, what you’re feeling is unlikely dissatisfaction with your current job, but lacking intrinsic motivators in general. Although you can find motivation by receiving more extrinsic motivators such as through a new job (meet new people, more pay, new work, etc.), but likely only stave off the feeling that you lack intrinsic motivators. Luckily, this is something you can solve yourself, or seek extrinsic motivators outside of work (job allows you the time and money to pursue your favorite hobbies).\n\nFind what motivates you, and if it ends up being a new job, go for it! But often, it’s not the job that makes you feel unfulfilled, although a new job can often temporarily provide this lack of fulfillment."

   "Title": "Is my new manager a red flag or am I imagining it ? ",
   "Top Comments": "To play devils advocate... your manager might be micromanaging you because they believe you need micromanaging.\n\nHear me out. You said you're new to the company, and have mentioned several times you haven't even got your local setup done yet.\n\nIncident 1 comes off to me as them being frustrated that despite not doing the most immediate task that they need you to do ASAP before they can get you started on real feature work that impacts the team's timelines, you're off thinking about deployment pipelines and attending optional tech fairs.\n\nI think this would have gone completely different if you did this 6+ months in, when you had already started being productive, had your setup done, and were doing real feature work.\n\nKinda the same for Incident 2. You're off having casual discussions with people about things unrelated to what you're supposed to be diong right now... setting up your local environment.\n\nIncident 3 can be seen as toxic, but I think it's a result of your manager being frustrated at your progress of your actual assigned work.\n\nIncident 4 is partly micromanagement, but also partly on you. Downloading a file for 3-4 hours isn't usually an excuse to standup and go do something else for 3-4 hours... Instead you just work on something else, or read some docs, or a million other things. Imagine you were in the office, what would you have done? Walked out and gotten a 4 hour lunch?\n\nOutside of that large 3-4 hour gap, monitoring your status contantly throughout the day is micromanagement, and that'd piss me off too. But like I said, I think this is stemming from the fact that your manager thinks you *need* micromanagement. Have you had a chat with them to understand their expectations of when your local setup should be done? Or are you just sorta winging it? Because it's entirely possible your manager expected this setup to take less than a week, so if you've been dragging it on.... enter micromanagement.\n\nDo they do this to anyone else? Or is it just you?; Your manager should ideally have a better communication style with you if you’re feeling this negative. I can see his point in a few of these though. \n\nTo the standard chorus of “start applying for a new job” replies, the market sucks so unless your environment is super toxic you should try to make it work. \n\n\nRe: Incident 1, do you have a deep understanding of your current pipeline? Do you know why it works the way it does? It’s good to be eager but you can come off as naive if you’re super new and are like, “hey, look at this shiny new thing, can we play with it” in a public channel if you’re still ramping up. \n\nFor 4, downloading or not, you just shouldn’t be unresponsive for over an hour when you’re WFH unless you’re very established or just have that norm with your team. You can also put up a status that you’re stepping away for a bit. Also, is there really nothing else you can be doing when you’re downloading a file?\n\nMonitoring active statuses is super obnoxious AND micromanagery, BUT you’ve given the impression to your boss that you’re not being as productive as you should be and that’s the easiest way for him to check on you when WFH. It’s literally his job to make sure you’re doing your job. I totally agree that sometimes the most important work is done thinking while not at your desk.; M1 sounds like he sucks and Incidents 1-3 are on him. Incident 4 is on you, downloading a big file is not an excuse for a remote employee to be offline for a few hours during the work day. Treating WFH as 'work optional' is a good way to lose it.; It’s definitely a little hands on.\n\nHowever, your excuse that “I get paid to think and do things at my own time” doesn’t apply if you don’t have the repo working locally, and are just going off having non related conversations.\n\nAdditionally, you get assigned one onboarding buddy because it takes a lot of time away from people when you just randomly ask them questions about things. You might “just be asking questions”, but you are still interrupting their work flow.\n\nFinally, waiting untill you understand the project to contribute ideas on what to use. Using projects from another team is unfortunately political, and just starting the conversation isn’t always appreciated, since it will take someone’s time to tell you “no”.\n\nMy advice, is that you need to focus more on what matters: getting your local dev env up, and contributing your first ticket. You’ll have time to learn everything and ask all the questions you want, but right now you’re taking a lot of resources to onboard and appear to be interested in other things; I mean number 4, that's just super unprofessional. ESPECIALLY If you never came to such an agreement\n\nYou are correct in that you don't get paid as some factory worker to create lines per day, but at the same time, you are also paid for expertise and be available during the day\n\nand the other 3, don't know really. seems like he feels you focus on anything except the \"real work\" therefore reminds you; Sounds like micromanagement but also you should be available at all times during working hours and respond promptly to messages. If you have software updates to complete, do it at end of the day or during lunch, to not use it as an excuse to be unable to work.\n\n Your manager will have you on thin ice the whole time, so its best to look for a new job/team or find ways to keep him from looking in your direction suspiciously; You said you started this new job recently - just how long exactly have you been at your new job?  Also, how well documented is the onboarding process for getting your local environment up and running?; I would add concise communication to the list of skills to learn. If this is how you handle everything i can see them getting frustrated.; Nah mate he’s a dick. Start looking for another gig.; Op - consider this scenario, your team has been short handed and it’s hard to hire people.  You’re a manager and you need the new person to help with the load.  The new team members environment is not setup and they are out at tech fairs and having conversations.  Everyone is rowing the boat but you…; Imagining it; Bro if you’ve been there more than a week and don’t even have your dev environment set up… even if that’s because their documentation and onboarding process is garbage… you should be laser focused on bugging whoever you need to bug to get that done, and nothing else.\n\nIn my opinion, even a week is really pushing it. A dev should be working on a ticket by the end of their second day in most cases.\n\nIf I were your manager you would be on very thin ice for being so casual about being completely unproductive multiple weeks into the job.; IMO it's not really possible for any of us to evaluate your productivity because we're not a part of your org, we don't have any details about your role, nor have you even said how long you've been employed. So those conversations are going to be inherently unproductive because they're based on the assumptions of random redditors.\n\nI think the fix for this issue is actually pretty straightforward but it might be uncomfortable for you. You will have to gently push back on requests from your manager that you find unreasonable in a polite manner. If my manager told me that I couldn't talk to another engineer, I would ask why., and then go from there eg:  \n  \n> \"We want to protect the team's time by limiting onboarding questions to your onboarding buddy, X\"  \n > \"Yes that makes sense, I will talk to my onboarding buddy X if I have any specific questions but I still may chat with other engineers from time to time if they are knowledgeable about a particular aspect of the product.\n\nWhen I say push back, I don't mean say \"no\". Try to understand why your manager might have made the request and assure them that their concerns can be met by other means.\n\nYou can also bring this up to your skip level manager. If you do so, approach it from the angle of getting some advice on how to work together effectively. You could also ask for clarification on some cultural aspects of the org, like asking if it's normal to be told not to talk to a senior engineer.\n\nUltimately, this is kind of an advanced lesson in how to work with someone that you don't work well with with. What you need to do is focus on communicating your expectations very explicitly and asking your manager to do the same. You also need to be proactive about pushing back on expectations/requests that you find unreasonable. This can be hard when you don't have a good relationship with the person, so you will have to be careful to keep it respectful.   \n  \nThe other part of this is that you need to deliver. Make your manager's life easier, anticipate their concerns, get things done, and they will start to leave you alone. You could also start DM'ing  them a bit more if you can think of questions that would make sense to ask them. It seems like they want to know you're working, so messaging them before they message you could help w this aspect.; I1 - You are wasting time. A joke we have around my company is that if you are a man of ideas and don't seem to have enough work rather than a do-er, it's time to get rid of you.  2021 was when a lot of men of ideas were getting hired for new whizbang technologies and projects including AI. 2024 is the \"Year of Efficiency\" as Zuckerberg says and it's time to get rid of BSers of ideas. \n\nI2 / I3 - M2 suspects you might not be capable of doing the job and wants to make sure you're not getting outside help to cover up. That's directly leading to the insulting question of what exactly did you work on yesterday. If you came up with a wishy washy, vague, politician answer, man of ideas answer, or BS answer, you've just taken another step closer towards getting fired.\n\nI4 - If you're going to play golf, at least create a meeting and join it so you appear like you're in a meeting with a red status. Then present something in the solitary so you get the \"presenter\" bonus.  If you're going to walk your dog, run that anti-idle script and make sure Teams or whatever is on your phone with notifications on.  All kidding aside, you better be responsive within minutes if they are sending chat messages to you. \n\nIt sounds like you are actually a do-er rather than a man of ideas. Get your work done pronto. The clock is ticking and this is a really tough job market to be fired.  My gut feeling is that you used up nearly all of the spare rope already so you better turn it around fast.; [deleted]; keep your head down. don't quit your job. look for other ones; smack him; He sounds like a very toxic manager. I have been in your shoes in the past, and it's extremely stressful. There is no way you can stay in your current role without impacting your mental and emotional health. Eventually, it'll have a ripple effect in other areas of your life. Start looking for other employment opportunities ASAP if you are unable to switch managers.; Insecure and toxic manager.; I was about to jump on the hate train, but your reply makes a lot of sense!

UX/UI developers who know what they are doing seem to be rare in my experience.; I totally understand CS doesn't feel like the right fit for you, but what makes you consider Graphic Design?\n\nA lot of fields do not require programming (such as accounting, finance, nursing, electricians, etc.), but that doesn't mean it's the right fit for you.\n\nMaybe start with *WHY* you want to pursue Graphic Design in the first place. If you are good in any areas, money will eventually follow. The most important thing is to have intrinsic motivation so that you can continue moving forward when things get tough.\n\nIf you choose Graphic Design, there are plenty of online platforms (i.e. Fiverr, Upwork) where you can offer freelancing to upgrade your skills.; From what I have noticed, I do better in creating social media content. So it’s either doing some social media marketing stuff or something similar. Graphic design uses software from what I have seen online (Figma, Adobe, etc) and I am quite really good at learning those and master them in a short period of time.\n\nPlus I have been creating content on TikTok and Instagram and received positive feedback telling me that I am creative in some sense. Hence I would like to incorporate the creativity with the Graphic design opportunities that may arise if I work in that field."

I'm just chilling here, probably gonna binge-watch some Netflix later. Also, any recommendations for what to watch? Always looking for something new. Anyway, hope you all have a fantastic day ahead!; Not sure where to ask this, but how much time should I take to prep for a tech interview at Big Tech for SWE mid/senior?  \ncontext: CS with 15YOE in no-names small companies what feel is like 6yoe working with really challenging teams and projects.; Why is this so hard to work on product instead of consulting with a junior profile ? I live in EU btw; With the development of ai and then being able to basically code on their own, will there be less software engineering jobs within the next few years?; Can some one help me find the discord link?; Seems like the secret to climb the corporate ladder fast can be watered down to choosing to do the unpaid work that has the most visibility you can find. Again and again. DAE find this correct in their career as well?; I wanna blow my brains out every single day.\n\nEveryone that I come across gets a job easily, me that I have sent more than a thousand CVs in months, gone to job expositions, worked on projects and connected with a bunch of recruiters only got 3 months of experience after sending CVs for more than three years.\n\nI seriously think I am stupid for choosing this career, and I want to end it immediately.; So, I find myself with two options at the moment, and I have no clue what to do. I hold a college degree in computer science and have been working for almost two years at the same company where I did my internship. Despite my efforts, I haven't had any luck in changing to a better-paid job.\n\nRecently, I've been considering going back to studies, and I have come up with these two options:\n\nOption 1: Go to university and finish the computer science degree. This process would take me around 2-3 years, depending on whether I go full-time or part-time.\n\nOption 2: Move to another city, which is a bit more expensive, where I could obtain a one-year certificate in cloud development with a coop term. It's important to note that in this city, job opportunities seem to be better than where I currently am.\n\nI am wondering if it is worth to pursue the Bachelor's in computer science from a university, opt for the one-year certificate from a college or just stay at my current job and wait until the job market gets better.\n\nWhat do you guys think?; Varies person-to-person. If it's been a while since you touched basic DS&A problems I'd give yourself at least 2-3 months to build back those fundamentals and be able to solve LC Mediums within a reasonable time frame. \n\nBesides LC I found Structy to be great for building back those fundamentals and Firecode to help with a more \"structured\" approach to LC problems.\n\nAt your YOE though I'd highly recommend leaning on system design components and practice those as well, as that will be more emphasized for more senior roles.; Doubtful.\n\nAI is not _that_ smart right now. In fact, i doubt AI can fix most bugs in existing software, especially if AI was the one who created those bugs in the first place. 💀 (AI might be able to eventually learn from its bugs/mistakes, but yeah…)\n\nAlso, i think there is a general distrust/uneasiness around AI when it comes to automatic code generation. Engineers here can say whatever the heck they want about AI trustworthiness, but the fact is that a lot of companies right now don't fully trust it, so many have not adopted it yet or they at least have restrictions on how it can be used.\n\nRight now, GitHub Co-Pilot is probably the main one that companies are looking at adopting. Some companies (like mine) have already gone ahead with allowing devs to use it. But honestly, Co-Pilot is fairly limited when it comes to the kind of work my company has us do.; my personal opinion is that AI is going to eliminate jobs long term and not be \"just a productivity tool\"; I might be reading this wrong but I don't understand why option 1 makes any sense if you already have a computer science degree?; Thank you!!  \nThat's very helpful. I'll check those other websites. I was aiming for 45 days taking 2 weeks PTO to dedicate myself.  \nI was \"Neetcoding\" roadmap few months ago, but didn't reach trees and graphs. I'm able to do medium, but not in 15min. IMHO I don't think I'm a unskilled dev, but I'm not used to dive into DSA problems in my work. It's just straight management of low-traffic ecommerce in RoR+frontend and fighting off bugs.; The computer science degree is at college level, and here in Quebec it does not have the same worth as a university degree, and I might be wrong but recruiters here seem to have a preference for university degrees; Is it still a bachelor degree? Are you saying recruiters prefers universities alumni due to reputation?"

This will take years to do, but unlike a degree you'll actually accumulate work experience and money instead of debt and possibly be facing the prospect of four years and god knows how much $$$ on being in the same place.; I think your presentation skill is better than a lot of software engineers (from your YouTube videos). \n\nYour biggest problem would be you are in lack of formal education, which would be screened by the filtering program quickly and easily. \n\nKeep an eye on the apprenticeship program . it is the type of program you have the biggest advantage on.; I would say contact your boot camp and ask them for help or tips on finding a job, but at this point I'm pretty sure they're all fully aware almost none of their students are going to get a job.; A CS degree.; You can try freelance work and use that as real work experience. \n\nYou can also do DataAnnotations.tech($40+/hr for coders) as a sidegig while applying for main gigs and between freelance projects. \n\nYou must have just missed the train, because I am working at faang for 3 years now after graduating coding bootcamp with no degree and no prior experience. \n\nMy resume was mainly focused on projects I completed, with what I learned/implemented, and of course all the tech/tools I used for them. Basically up top under my name I started with a projects section. I had no relevant work experience, so i put that at the bottom, focusing on leadership and softskills I learned from them.\n\nI also had a small coding youtube and talked about that during my interview. Talking about how I built it to help others learn complex concepts in a simple manner. \n\nHonestly I think the hardest part was getting an interview, but you also gotta be very very prepared for the couple interviews you get. I applied for about 8 months and got about 4 interviews and 2 offers from those 4 interviews. Learn a lot about the company and talk about what the company would gain from hiring you, rather than what you want.; Why do people keep expecting a secure job after a bootcamp ? I swear only CS is dumbed down like this.; >I'm also very picky about the jobs I apply for. I don't apply to 100 jobs a day. This is a waste of time as I'm not qualified for 100% of the jobs posted on job sites. I choose 10-30 within my grasp, then move on to coding for the rest of the day.\n\nI think this is a good approach. The only thing I do want to point out is that it is not your job to determine whether you're qualified. That's the burden of whoever is receiving your resume.\n\nOne question is: Do you send the exact same resume to every place? Because when starting out it might help to tailor your resume and so forth to the job you're applying for.\n\n>Built 7 projects learning and honing new skills: Python Next.js TailwindCSS Typescript Mongodb React Native / Expo Go Vercel\n\nHow extensive are these projects?\n\n If these projects are sizeable and have some meat to them (Being properly fleshed out), sure - then it makes sense that you've spent 2 years on them. If they are mostly based on tutorials or simply lack any heft to them, then that is a problem.\n\n>Besides networking IRL, what am I missing? What can I do more to stand out?\n\nIt's hard to say specifically. All I know is that you have 7 projects, which isn't much information. I know that you've had people look at your resume, but I haven't.\n\nThe point here is that it is hard to say how you can stand out when I have zero information about your current standing. Your post would be better served with a link to your portfolio and an anonymised version of your resume.; You lost me at Started YouTube channel; You said it yourself: \"Besides networking IRL\". That's the answer. The fact you got interviews by cold applying shows you're qualified for those. \n\nYou present yourself at local meetups and career fairs and knock on doors. It will happen.; Try cold emailing small local dev shops near you. Be polite and link your portfolio.; You should not withhold from applying to positions because you believe its a waste of time considering your qualifications. Unless its a location/salary/moral conflict, just throw your resume in the mix and be open to learning on the fly. Right now, applying for jobs and securing interviews is simply a numbers game, you should not expect to receive responses from any one specific place, just apply to as many as you believe you could be ready for and keep going.\n\nDepending on how it is asked, you are probably getting filtered out based on YOE. There's times, on Indeed for example, when you'll be prompted to answer an employer question that happens to be YOE. I feel like these are quick, automated ways of filtering out candidates before a real human actually reviews your application, so this is probably the only time your experiences acts as a hard stop for your candidacy. Don't be afraid to embellish your experience if you're not far from the requirement, at least try to get your name in front of a real human.\n\nYou should take a look at how many positions you've applied for vs how many responses you have received to make sure your resume is doing what it should. In my experience, 6-7 legitimate responses for every 100 applications sent seems to be a decent ratio. If you aren't seeing at least this, especially with your picky choices, then you should consider modifying your resume again. There really is no use in investing time to learning/honing new skills when you aren't properly in the race. Same logic applies to technical interview prep, etc.\n\nSounds like you are being productive with your time though, don't be discouraged from lack of responses. That's unfortunately the norm right now.; Do you have any degree at all?\n\nCan you get a BS CS, MS CS, and or PhD CS degree?; Boot camp is one thing but what about credentials? Did you go to an accredited university for software engineering or computer science? ; Have you tried interviewing with the WITCH companies?; As someone who is making $200k+ in a tech role with a JOURNALISM degree and no boot camp or CS degree in any way, here is the path I took:\n\n1. You have to greatly reduce your expectations at this moment. You have no experience, which is what most employers are looking for. Drop the fantasy of getting a 6 figure job in a desirable city or location, you need to get your foot in the door by any means possible.\n2. You need experience, some experience, any experience of something along the lines of writing code or crunching numbers. One good way to do this is explore more junior roles in smaller cities, lower cost of living areas that aren't going to be saturated with college graduates. A place where having a degree of any kind is a plus, because the talent pool in the area is likely to not have one\n\nIn 2014, I had been in the journalism field for 3 years, not making a lot of money. Looking for something else, I saw a small market TV station in Iowa was hiring someone to do station analytics and research for them. I threw my hat in the ring and got hired. I only got paid $30k a year (in 2014 this was enough for Iowa). I wasn't living the most glamarous lifestyle, and actually got a 2nd job on nights and weekends as a bartender, but I was gaining valuable experience showing I could at least crunch numbers. After a year and a half, this experience got me a job in Seattle for a large well known company. And after 2 years in Seattle, I moved again, now finally making over $100k for a job in the Southern US. So basically in 2014 I was making $30k and then in 2017 I was making over $100k. So I invested 3 years of my life at lower paying 2 jobs in Iowa/Seattle gaining the experience I needed to make a decent amount of money. Well worth it. And these days companies love my journalism background because it shows I am a great communicator - a major downfall I see from CS grads, they can write code and crunch numbers but have shit communication and people skills.\n\nIt's unrealistic to expect to get a dev or SWE or data science job paying 6 figures in NYC or the Bay Area or Austin right out of a boot camp. But, I guarantee you there is a company in Nebraska, or South Dakota, or Idaho, or West Virginia, or Alabama who is looking for someone competent and doesn't have a lot of strong candidates in the local talent pool. Yeah, it will require moving, Yeah, it will require moving to a smaller city or town that isn't the most exciting. The pay won't be great (although the COL will be low). But, you will get what you desperately need, experience. If you can stick it out for a year or two like I did, you'll finally have the experience on your resume that will become a ladder to higher paying jobs.; Get a degree, no way to compete without one in this market; I know this may not help much but tech layoffs over the last 2- 3 years have flooded the job market with engineers with all sorts of backgrounds making it super competitive. Its not just tough for you, but for everyone out there. Its not all doom and gloom though. The top comment is valid and folks are still hiring. You got this.; I think formal education. A real degree from a university. There's too many people looking for jobs that only did bootcamps and other courses, so companies got picky too: they started asking for actual degrees now. It seems to be a pretty strong filtering condition.\n\nAnd don't get discouraged. There's people with degrees and some experience who go through many more than 3 failed tech interviews before getting a real offer. Just keep trying while you get formal education and you'll eventually land a good position.; I’m in the same boat and have been working at a very early stage Ed Tech startup for about 7 months now (literally was there when we were deciding on what technologies, workflow, etc.). I’ve been lucky that it has been a project I care a great deal about, but I will say that I’ve usually had to work double the hours than what I was being paid (trust me, I truly understand that I’m very lucky to have been paid anything at all in the first place). While here, I’ve gotten the incredible chance to actually contribute meaningful code (yes, my code has ACTUALLY been used) and two of the features I was responsible for rolling out were highly praised and accounted for 42% of the investments we secured! \n\nNonetheless, I’ve still been applying to other jobs (sadly, education funds are still very iffy after COVID), and still cannot seem to get interviews (even though I try to pinpoint places that I’d be a good fit for). I’ve also done actual college coursework and even did a partial masters degree (I had an unfortunate & unexpected family incident that forced me to drop the program), but do not have an undergraduate degree in CS (although I do have a different four-year STEM degree).\n\nI feel you OP, and if anyone has any suggestions (that isn’t straight up bashing) for my situation as well that may be a bit more specific I’d be very thankful. 🙏"

If you have the option of working and doing an MS degree you are interested in that has employment prospects, that sounds like an amazing option.\n\nYou might consider reducing effort into job search tasks and increasing effort into getting an MS program started or maybe hobby projects.; The experience feels like a job market issue. You got to flow with the way the market it. Couple phone interviews for 200 applications sounds about right. Although it sucks, I think op needs to submit another 800 applications. Because maybe another 8 to 10 phone interviews could provide a chance to get some tech interviews. This is all a big funnel. One way to improve funnel output is increase the numbers.; Yes. It would be a Master of Science in Computer Science that my company would pay 70-100% for. I’ve already applied and been accepted into a few programs.; Thanks for the response. My thought process is: why would I spend the time and energy to submit 800 other applications when I have a perfectly fine job rn? Wouldn’t I be better off spending that time improving my skills via side projects or a Master’s degree (or something else), and then starting to apply when the market is better. This would ensure a higher ROI on my applications and time.; Well I thought the goal was to get a better paying job in a better location. So towards that end, I figure you could spray and pray.\n\nIf you already have a CS degree, I would not think a masters in CS would help much. If you don't have a CS or related degree, maybe an MSCS would be good. Side projects might be good if they would help you learn new tech. You could be doing these whether you are looking for another job or not.\n\nGood luck whatever you decide.; I don't exactly have a traditional CS degree, but it's pretty close. I took most core CS and Math classes that CS majors take (aside from OS, Networks). I want to do the MS in order to bridge the gaps in my knowledge with the lower level courses like OS and Networks, but also go more deep into Distributed Systems and Systems Design. In addition, I want to go deeper into AI/ML since I only took one AI course and one ML seminar in my undergrad. \n\nI do agree with you that I should be able to also continue applying to other jobs while I am doing these things, however the point I am trying to make is that my FOCUS would not be on applying to jobs, but rather improving my skills. Anyway, I appreciate your advice and will take it into account."

So net I pay $160 a year for health insurance.; > for the big tech companies\n\n  \nOnce you're looking at big tech salaries, I've found benefits like health insurance to mostly be a rounding error. Especially after you're mid level or above. So I'd be concerned if any company's selling point was health insurance; I don't know what the percentage is, but I know it's free if you're single and choose the HDHP. They also give $2k per year towards an HSA.; 0 but they are moving to 20% (80% whichever way you see it) soon to be market equivalent. Complete morons with this move; Most of my jobs have covered about 80-90% of the cost from what they show me. Bigger issue is how good is the insurance. Current job covers most of the cost but it's not very good anymore, it was ok when I started. My wife got her old job back at a hospital so she could use their insurance to have a baby there as it is much better than mine. Apple had the best insurance of all the places I worked. ; 100% of a HDHP plan for me. 80% of the difference to add my spouse. Plus an employer HSA contribution that is more than the premium and doubles for family coverage.; 85%; For the employee, it's next to nothing on your end. I pay $25 a month for medical and I think like 7 for dental, vision is free. It's family plans that will get you as that's not covered by the company, at least in my experience.; $40/bi weekly for hdhp ($1600 deductible), with $800 for HSA.; 100%, and there's no deductible.  Last I checked the family plan (covers my wife and I, but in theory the same plan can cover kids as well) costs them a bit north of $2k/month, but it's probably gone up since then.  I don't think I've paid more than a $10-$15 copay for any appointment since taking this job.; My work offers three options (high deductible PPO, HMO, low deductible PPO).\n\nFirst two are covered 100% for employee, and somewhere around 90% for spouse and children. In fact, they pay you with an HSA top up if you take the first option.\n\nI’m on the most expensive plan (low deductible PPO) and they cover 82% for my entire family. If it was just me it would be 95%.; I pay $58 a paycheck and my company matches $25 of HSA contributions per paycheck. So 43% I suppose.; It depends on which option I choose. My company actually has a plan where they cover 100% of premiums. It comes with a huge deductible though. I tried that for a while when I never visited any doctors. Now I opted for one of the more standard plans, and the company picks up 80% of the premiums for that. Both feel like a good deal.; 100% no deductible, $5 prescription. Includes my family as well.; at all companies I pay a big fat $0 for health insurance\n  \nI remember there was 1 company where I actually had to pay something (maybe like $10? $15? per paycheck so roughly $20-30 a month) for pretty much a 0-deductible PPO"

Even more simple entry-level web dev positions in frontend will have insane competition (500\\~1000+ people applying for the role).\n\nMy brother has a material engineering degree and got an internship at a startup working as a fullstack web developer. He is now a junior fullstack web developer on the same startup. Therefore, the STEM to tech transition is possible, albeit, quite difficult and you're less hireable than a CS degree new grad.\n\nData science has somewhat of a requirement of having a Masters/PhD in Math/Statistics/Data Science, it's really hard to break into data science without those.\n\nIT support, help desk type jobs are easier to join and you can eventually try to transition to sysadmin, software engineer, cloud engineer, devops engineer, etc. P.S.: the transition may be difficult and it depends on the acquired professional experience quality/exposure.\n\nI don't know a lot about cybersecurity in general but I believe it's also harder to get these roles as a CS degree new grad because it seems you kinda need to have strong knowledge with network low-level stuff.; i heard welding is the next big thing\n\nchatgpt it; r/learnprogramming; Given that you already have a job and are just sort of chilling I would recommend something like Automate the Boring Stuff for an introduction into programming, by Al Sweigart. From there you can decide if you want to keep exploring or might want to try something else.; It's my case, I transitioned from business to data. What's key when you engage in a career switch is to be clear about your motivation to make the change (money, like solve complex problems, etc.). You should choose a domain you like and are interested in. For that, you need to explore different roles (linkedin can be your best friend for that). There are also career simulators that can provide guidance about the roles fitting your profile and expectations like this one [https://www.mysmartcareer.site/](https://www.mysmartcareer.site/) With your role explorations your can pick the right career to pursue being confident about the investment you'll make interm of effort, money, and time. \n\nDepending on the role your select to transition to, the time might be variable (usually 6 month). You should consider not only following courses but rather getting your hands dirty and learning by doing (it's the best way of learning).; It's disappointing to hear someone who finished a full material engineering degree just not use that and get generic web dev jobs.; If only I could practice welding overnight at the hotel"

Perfect 4.0 GPA.  Worked an internship while in school with the College’s cybersecurity team, and got a job after school with a local Telecom company doing WebDev for their sales CRM.  Was laid off late last year and now having an impossible time with the job search.; I graduated from one in december 2022 and got a tech support job that turned out to be exactly what I was trying to escape (msp IT work).  The pay, when compared to salaries for MSP roles in less expensive areas, was the same.  They fired me five months after they forced me to move across the country to the bay area.  Employers offering regular programming roles won't even give me a chance.\n\nThe market collapsed right as I was graduating.  What they sold me was probably at the tail-end of being true when I started but I knew it was dead by the time I finished.  I don't know if that's their fault, but selling it that way now is absolutely deceptive and wrong.; Yeah it’s crazy. Someone I know recently told me he was planning to finish a boot camp, get hired for a DevOps role at 130-150k/yr, and work remotely from South America where COL is much cheaper.\n\nIn what world?!; turns out the best boot camp all along was your local community college; I work at a bootcamp that is closing down. There are no nefarious people here, just people disappointed that the amazing work we do is ending. \n\nIt was a great business with great people who cared about your learning experience. We use modern pedagogy with an unbelievable amount of support. Many say they wished this form of applied learning was how they could have learned things in high school or college. Thousands of students have gotten jobs over the years. And we never have had a job guarantee. To do otherwise even 3, 5 or 10 years ago would be to sell snake oil. \n\nthe market is over saturated, and we were telling our students how overwhelmed the market is. It’s why we are stopping. But I 100% stand by the quality of the education we provided. Most graduates doubled or in some cases tripled their original salary, found a career that was satisfying without making them tired, and love their craft. \n\nThere were good bootcamps, and there are still major gaps between CompSci degrees. But yes, the market is too saturated for them to make any sort of job guarantee, and if a bootcamp is making a job guarantee they are likely being purposely misleading. \n\nBut it is also highly unregulated. In fact, a “job placement” means completely different things to bootcamps unless a state has formal regulations on the vocab (unlikely) or if they were a part of the opt in CIRR consortium for ethical bootcamp reporting (many were not, and most major bootcamps did not). \n\nUsually it actually reflects the percentage of students who completed all technical exams and arbitrary course requirements AND got a job. Some have a very high bar for said requirements, meaning program participants and program “graduated” are two very different things, allowing them to conflate numbers. Finally, reporting to the bootcamp on if you got hired can also be a requirement for keeping graduate status. So if you get a job or don’t get a job, but never contact the bootcamp again, many can write you off and not include you in the final tally. ; While your intent of this post may be accurate (that they should read the room), saying they should all be liable for the current market conditions is delusional. \n\nYou, the consumer of their services, are liable for your choices to join a boot camp. \n\nThey aren’t fraudulent. \n\nThe person selling ice to an Eskimo is not fraudulent so long as they represent it appropriately at ice. They are not responsible for the Eskimo not looking outside to realize there’s no need for ice.; It's not a scam. They are teaching you how to code. It's the promise of a job afterwards that's problematic imo. As long as they aren't guaranteeing a job for you but then not even offer interviews with prospective clients, it's just another service that is becoming less relevant in the short term.; I remember there was a TV episode or something where the host was saying something like \"I'm sorry, but 'why are you letting us fucking you over' is not a valid reason\"\n  \nand I was like \"hmmm I'm sorry... but that's actually a perfectly valid reason in USA\"\n  \nif you think about it, the entire world operates on how to get you to part ways with your money, that's why it's incredibly easy to lose money in stock markets or in your case be sold the shovel: you want to give away YOUR money? oh that's super easy, you want OTHERS to give you their money? well... it's a problem humankind has been trying to solve since the beginning of humankind; People are taking out loans and not getting jobs… have to pay back that loan. \n\nPeople are saying the ISA is a scam? If anything, the ISA is great in this case. You don’t get a job you don’t need to pay simple as that.; Lol when the market was good bootcamps are like the holy grails for a quick and easy job. When the market is bad, the very exact bootcamp is called scam. Bootcamps themselves are not inherently bad; it’s just how you look at it.; Im the era of golden rush, the money were done selling shovels. People still not understand that those videos of “one day in a life of a SWE in a FAANG” are not real and only a few privileged got them.\n\nSorry but if you want to have to have that kind of work you will have to show that you are really talented and really like the work, cause the money that you are getting paid it’s because you have to update your skills and knowledge every 6 months minimum.; They are teaching the same thing but it’s not fraud in 2021 but fraud in 2024?; In the UK some of the bootcamps are being banned.; What about it do you think is fraud; Oh the ads i see are the worst to - want a remote high paying job but dont want to go to school or work hard?

You're going to have to supplement it with on campus involvement/side jobs that are relevant (eg web dev for a random small biz in town, it support for your schools help desk, etc) but CIS degrees will get lumped in with the \"degree requirements\". A lot of big co job postings will read \"bachelor in computer science, information systems/information technology, other engineering discipline, math\" or something along those lines. \n\nAfter you have actual work experience, it won't matter much.; Yes, it’ll affect your chances. ; On the surface, my company and I would not care if you got a CS or CIS degree. Both meet the minimum requirements for a software engineering position at my company. Of course we will need to see how good you are. But from a degree perspective, I think CIS is fine. If there are two candidates who are exactly the same, and one has a CS and the other CIS, I would pick the CS person. However this is a contrived scenario, and most of the time, no 2 candidates are exactly the same.; I don't think it makes financial or educational sense to graduate 2.5 years later for a minor change in degree classification. It will delay getting work experience, add to your student debt and set back personal milestones in your life.\n\nPlus a lot of roles in data science, especially entry level jobs, place a heavy emphasis on domain knowledge and soft skills, so you may be underestimating the utility of a CIS degree when you're going for job titles like Business Analyst, Data Analyst, Application Support Analyst etc. In this market this may be where you start and then work your way up.\n\nI feel it's worth adding that my perspective comes from somebody who has mostly worked in no name companies, so if you want that shiny FAANG MLE role then my advice isn't applicable.; CIS is a good degree, as long as you take plenty of advanced CS courses to get your projects in, and have a really good understanding of data structures and algorithms.\n\nWhy is CIS good? Because every system you interact with as a SWE in industry will be some type of information system. I just think the degree has good exposure to the exact sort of problems you are solving, where CS is broad prep in the academic field of computer science.\n\nThat said, what's more important than the degree you have, is how well you perform in that degree program, and how much you learn. I did biology as an undergrad with lots of research experience, and that might not have been great prep to get a programming job, I did learn a valuable skillset.; I'd go with CS. \n\nCIS sounds like \"lighter CS\" which already would put you at a disadvantage when looking at resumes.; For the jobs you're aiming for it most likely will. Many/most entry level CS jobs require a CS or STEM equivalent degree. My understanding is the CIS is usually considered a business degree with some CS elements. Some companies will care about the difference and others might not.; As someone with a Communications and CIS degree this a 100%. Managed to get my foot in the door by becoming a solutions engineer at Oracle. Volunteered for a bunch of side coding projects to get experience then switched jobs to make the full leap to software developer.; [removed]; Maybe at FAANG but generally no it won't lol.

Reflog/reset —hard every week. Cherry-pick every now and then. Branch/checkout sometimes.

New features are cloud only.\n\nYou’ll know the programming language but your knowledge of JIRA APIs/infernals would not be very useful in the future, IMO.; A lot of salesforce development is Lightning Web Components which is JavaScript. There’s a ton you can do no code as well. It’s an interesting niche. Lot of opportunities in consulting; Lightning Web Components -- a JS framework used in Salesforce development -- can at least serve as a bridge to learning React and/or Angular easily enough if you go the Salesforce route, if you are concerned about web dev skills. Plus, Salesforce is extremely certification-heavy, meaning if you spend a few years acquiring certifications, you'll have an advantage over newcomers.\n\nAs someone else said, Salesforce experience opens up opportunities with consulting companies. I would recommend taking a more in-depth look at some Trailhead modules (official Salesforce training) and see what you think. If you like it, it pays decently once you have some experience and certifications.\n\nConversely, I briefly tried Salesforce development, got a few certifications, and later realized I didn't particularly enjoy it for a number of reasons, which is why I strongly recommend researching it before diving into that role. If I were in your shoes, I'll admit I'd probably go for the Jira role so I could list Java on my resumé and then jump ship once I acquired some experience, but it sounds like you won't get much in the way of frontend experience in that role, which could be a concern for you.; [removed]; [removed]; Jira developer seems more transferable, but as someone who spends a bit too much time on LinkedIn I feel like I've seen way more salesforce dev opportunities.

Very few people are going to hire a 3mo bootcamp grad over people holding bachelors, masters and phds; Hire train deploy companies suck ass but could be an option for you; What they are saying is that they would like a mid level developer but pay him as if he is a junior."

Self-destructive thing you do subconsciously.\n\nTry to stick in this field a little more and get your head straight before making any change.; The night is darkest before the dawn.; [removed]; [removed]; Hey, don't give up unless you _truly_ dislike programming! Many new grads struggle with the transition from school to workforce, so you are not the only one! School and work are very different vibes.\n\nThe aim of a CS degree is to provide you with foundational knowledge related to software engineering, such fundamental mathematics, basic algorithms, etc., but most of your actual learning starts when you get your first job! So don't feel bad that you do not know things right away.\n\nBtw, it is very common (IMO) to start your first job in software and feel lost, inadequate, and/or inept. Rarely is anyone _truly_ inadequate or inept, though. People just feel that way because a lot of what they learned in school doesn't directly apply to their job. Like, it probably does apply in some way, but you're not (for example) going to be asked to regurgitate a sorting algorithm like you would in school.\n\nThat said, I strongly recommend seeking out a mentor at your company. Start by asking your manager to see who can help you. Your manager should be able to find either a teammate or another person in the company, or they should be able to point you to an internal resource for requesting one. It sounds like you need somebody to push you in the right direction sometimes, and there is nothing wrong with that. Once you get your momentum going, you will feel much more confident!; who will be our next president to save us? Truml who signed section 174? Joe Biden who is too old can't even think? Or Hillary?

All contracts have an expiration date. If the prime has more contracts coming through the door, it would make more to go with them. Same thing goes for the sub.; It's a pretty good deal on your part, since it's just more options to choose from. Are you currently living 100 miles from home? If so, you'd benefit from the per diem pay. Otherwise, you may be paid more base salary yet lose health care.; I wouldn't move down to the sub contractor for the same pay.

   "Title": "Ask my manager for raise and promotion",
   "Top Comments": "You make peanuts there, that's like new grad salary. If they haven't given you a raise now after 3 years they aren't going to do it. I'd look for a new job because they are comfortable underpaying you and not giving you raises. With 7 years of experience you could be making double what you make now. ; > I have not received one promotion at this company since I joined, though my manger says it’s going to happen.\n\nSorry, but I have been in your shoes. The kind of thing you're going through right now is precisely why I left my last job. My manager kept saying for 1 year that I was going to get promoted, but then he always came up with some BS excuse as to why it couldn't happen. Excuses ranged from \"team budget\" (because promotion means raise) to \"company did not perform well this quarter. Stocks were down.\"\n\nLong story short, it was a new excuse every time. That is when I realized that he just kept coming up with random shit instead of advocating for me, even though I consistently received \"exceeds expectations\" ratings during my quarterly reviews. It turns out he just wanted to use the team budget for other things and he noticed that I stayed at the company despite his empty promises every few weeks. So, he had no motivation to change his behavior. He was going to keep stringing me along for as long as he could because I was (stupidly) willing to accept that behavior.\n\nObviously I left, but you are likely in a similar situation where your boss is seeing you tolerate his lies. He has no need to promote you because he is seeing that you accept his lies.; My approach would be to gradually decrease my workload and increase my interview preparation. At 7 YoE, it shouldn’t be difficult to exceed $86k TC.; This is kind of like the r/relationships sub where the answer is usually \"leave 'em\".\n\nWhat leverage do you have? None, until you get another offer.; Honestly, you should find another job. You're being underpaid at $86k even in today's market. At the very least you should try to switch to a different manager. \n\n> My manager is kind of a dick and he takes all the praise for our team’s accomplishments. I’ve been at this company for 3 years and worked on some of the hardest projects and have performed very well\n\nSame here. I know exactly what it feels like and it's not easy to get past this. My manager received a promotion despite being mediocre in many ways. My motivation has dropped to zero and I'm just hoping I can switch to a new project.; Based on your experience, accomplishments, and overall tenure (without actually being there to experience your work) I think these are fair expectations.\n\nHowever, I don't think its necessarily realistic to ask and get a \"yes\" for either (or both) of those things especially if your manager has been stringing you along up until now.\n\nGenerally the path towards a promotion is:\n\n - Start early in having conversations with your manager to set concrete expectations on what they want to see from you to get promoted.\n\n - Consistently execute on and meet/surpass these expectations over an extended timeframe (documenting successes, keeping manager looped in on them).  \n - Continuously bringing these things up with your manager and getting them to agree to put you up for promotion.\n\nIf none of this has been happening it might be difficult to get anything out of it on short notice.  \nBut, you won't know unless you try. Just have realistic expectations.\n\nWith all of that being said, you are underpaid for your experience. If you are not happy with your salary it is in your own hands to remedy that situation by looking elsewhere. You can always bring a counter-offer to your current employer who may or may not match it (and people have varying opinions on if you should accept a counter) - or go to a new place that values you more.; Using another job offer can backfire. They might just give it to you, then start looking for your replacement right away. Then you will end up jobless with the job offer gone. \n\nShould they not fire you, they won't give you another raise for the next 6 years... so just find a new job.; Asked for raise and got it; \"Hey I'm thinking I'm pretty far under the market rate for my skills, experience level, and contributions. Some buddies of mine have tried talking to me about applying where they work, and I'm not really interested in leaving, but I know that they are making around $X, which is Y% more than me. I'd really like to stay, but could we work on a plan to get me to $X over the next two years?\"  \nIt doesn't matter if your buddies making $X actually exist, as long as $X is reasonable and within the range that your company can pay.  \nYou gotta do a number of things in this conversation:  \n1. Tell them you haven't applied, and aren't interviewing  \n2. Tell them you're happy and you want to stay  \n3. Give them a number you want to hit  \n4. Give them ore than just one adjustment period to hit it  \n\nUsually managers can't just make big swings on people's pay in one go. HR blocks them, their bosses block them, etc. But if they can plan out a raise, then a promotion, then another raise, that makes it a lot easier. Plus it shows that the employee has long term plans to stick around. HR and upper management usually don't react well if you come at them with a competing offer and an ultimatum, but if you can keep that part informal and between your manager and yourself, you can avoid that.; It literally is. I made around that as a new grad (in 2023) at a non-tech company whose stock is down 50%+ from all time highs 7-10 years ago; Yeah, I got the job when I was desperate for work and I took what they offered. I have 4 years experience in full-stack and several years in data science (I have random experience in different things because I worked for several startups).

   "Title": "Tips to succeed as a New Grad ",
   "Top Comments": "Things you should be doing that are not technical in nature:\n\n  - Make sure your manager sets clear expectations with you. If they do not, then you need to ask them what their expectations are.\n  - Always ask questions and raise concerns if you are unsure about something.\n  - Do not start any project or task until you understand what is being asked. This ties back to the previous bullet point.\n  - Ask your manager in advance for a mentor or someone who you can reach out to for help. You do not have to meet with them every day. They are just a resource.\n  - If you are struggling with something, make sure you have read the relevant documentation and that you have done appropriate searches _first_ (Google, work chat rooms, company internal site, etc.). Then, when you reach out to a teammate for help, ask your question and tell them what you have done to troubleshoot the problem. (Many new grads make the mistake of asking a teammate instead of doing a basic Google, etc search.)\n  - If someone points out a mistake you made, don't blindly fix it or blindly accept the person's solution. First, understand _why_ your mistake is a mistake and _then_ understand the solution provided to you. Follow up and ask questions as needed.; Yup. Amazon is a PIP factory; - Don't get stuck for too long, if you can't figure out something ask for help. Use team channels if possible for higher visibility and to get inputs from more than one person. \n- If you are blocked on something, make sure your manager is aware.\n- Imo it's a good idea to reread onboarding docs / videos for your team's services after 1-2 months. When you do that for the first time during onboarding, you might lack context / be overwhelmed with other things, so things make a lot more sense after.; soft skills are way more important than you will ever appreciate\n\npay close attention to the effective leaders\n\nfight for a seat at the table\n\nlearning commitment outside of billable hours does not stop with the degree; You'll have trouble when you start but you'll also figure it out. The biggest tip I can give is to write everything down. Put it on the ticker or keep it for yourself but it'll be useful. Also while you are doing tasks keep a track of what you are doing, it'll be useful at the end of the year.; Grind girls and leetcode in yo college.; Try to have a paper trail of anything important. For example 121s with your manager I try to follow up in an email stating what was talked about. \n\nIf I needed to do something like I need to bring in X amount of Y for the next promotion cycle. I have it in an email stating exactly that and then throughout the year I have a tracker of stuff I accomplished and when it comes down the wire that they try to say \"..oh no you need to also do A for B.\" Um negative and I'll tell you exactly why because I have proof that you're lying right here.; >Always ask questions and raise concerns if you are unsure about something.\n\nAll of these are great pieces of advice. One more thing to add is not to *repeat* asking the same questions multiple times. Once you ask the questions, make sure to record or document your findings so that you can always refer back to your notes when you have similar questions.; [deleted]; What’s pip; tfw went to canadian uni that elon went to for girls and was not disappointed\n\ngoing to school for the education is like taking oxy for pain lmao; Around 3.5 months on average.; Pan-anal Implant Preparation; Fr?; It's a joke. Obviously that's not the case.; Hopefully, ur prob right. I’m there now and just moved cities to work there. Def feel like I’m underperforming at times but not sure how much of that is adjusting/ramping up and how much of that is me not being good enough. Would suck so much to get pipped after locking myself into an apt lease in the new city, but hopefully they’d at least give good severance? Altho I heard they give less severance for getting pipped than laid off.; I was joking lol. Even with pip culture, it's inefficient to fire a new grad after 3.5 months.\n\nEspecially in a company of that scale, there is so much internal tooling that you need to learn to be productive. So, if you are a new grad, no one is going to be expecting you to be productive after 3.5 months and it would just be a waste of resources for the company to invest so much in training someone new just to fire them so quickly. \n\nFor what it's worth, I've been there and it felt like it took me ~6 months to get productive and after ~2 years didn't see any full time engineer in my team get piped, the ones that left did it voluntarily because they were unhappy with the company and got a job elsewhere. \n\nBut obviously it's a huge company, and things will vary a lot depending on your team and org.; Thanks, that’s a good data point. I haven’t seen anyone on my team get pipped but I’ve heard it’s common so I’m not sure how it manifests.; Right the thing is that whatever story you read online can come from a totally different org where things are totally different and obviously the people with the worst experiences get more attention online. \n\nAt least in my org, I feel like the experience I've had is very different from a lot of the horror stories from the internet. But I think I'm also lucky that I'm in a team that owns a critical service, so it's not something people would want to get rid off.\n\nI would definetely not expect a pip within the first year at least since it's inefficient for the company (unless it's a mass lay off or if you are actually terrible). \n\nThat being said, I think the best bet is to be always prepared for the worst. You have a high salary and a big hiring bonus, so make sure you keep your hiring bonus as an emergency fund in case of the worst. And make sure you invest/save a good part of your income every month. \n\nOne of the good things of having a high paying job, is that if you lose it you should be able to take care of the bills for the time being.\n\nThe one other thing is that (if the timing of your lease allows it), try to wait for your yearly performance review before renewing it (at least for me the timing makes it possible, but obviously might not be the case for you).; Thanks for the advice. Am definitely saving the signing bonus/a good portion of the take home, especially after I read the part abt the signing bonus being able to be taken back(minus pro-rated portion “earned” over the first year), if employment is terminated for any reason. Which I took to mean they could legally fire me and take back the signing bonus lol. Hopefully my org doesn’t have layoffs, that’s a good point abt the yearly performance review, I’ll have to keep my eyes peeled and try to perform well enough to get a good review. I think I’ll be ok as far as being able to renew the lease after the performance review too, I was remote for the first month and didn’t find a place till a month in.\nThanks for the advice, appreciate it"

An associate's is a waste and won't get you very far. When you apply for jobs nowadays, most employers send out auto rejections if you do not have at least a bachelor's in CS or Computer Engineering. Or, their job application platform outright prevents you from submitting an application in the first place.\n\nFWIW, most people who get bachelor's degrees in CS cannot afford them initially either. They usually take out a loan and/or apply for grants and scholarships. They may also work part-time during their undergrad studies.\n\nIf I'm blunt, a bachelor's degree in CS is not like getting a bachelor's in Gender Studies. The CS degree pays itself off relatively quickly (less than 10 years for most). If you were doing Gender Studies, then yeah, I would say you will probably never pay that shit off and you might as well live in squalor forever, but that is different.\n\nWhat I suggest: go to whatever college you are currently enrolling in, and after your first year, apply to their bachelor's program.

But you need to at least have a BS.

Laughably trivial, in fact.\n\n\n\"Just\" create a complete, ready-to-ship product. Build it from scratch, or somehow pay for a team. Can't be more than a few dozen years of work, right? Nobody is going to need a roof over their head, or food on their table from now until the time it's ready.\n\n\nIt's going to sell itself for sure.

No need to bother with those pesky sales people, advertisement, let alone all nonsensical accounting bullshit. Maybe a la ding page, surely you can whip that up on the side what with all of your free time seeing of how all of the other stuff will basically be super easy.\n\n\nAnd if that sounds like it would be too easy, just freelance! You can't throw a stone without hitting a dozen people that have a hundred couple k to waste to have custom software build.; I mean, that's exactly what ConcernedApe did when he couldn't find a job. He made Stardew Valley which net about $30M iirc.; Because most startups fail. Truth is it's a better use of ones time to try to get a job than spend  60+ hours a week, mostly for free, toiling to get a startup going. There's a LOT of work that goes into creating and maintaining a successful agency.; Because finding a good idea is hard.; something you'll realize sooner or later is that if you have money, it's really easy to make more money, but the real question is \"how much\"? \n  \nfor example let's say I indeed create my own startup and brought in let's say... $50k/year for the first year, do I call that a win? no\n  \nI didn't gain $50k I **lost** at least $150k+, because that's time I could have otherwise been working for someone else (and bringing in salary)\n  \nso, it's not hard to make money, but it **IS** really hard to make enough money to the point that it can replace your (real) job's income; For one I’m a software engineer and not a marketer, financial manager, or investor and I don’t know how to raise capital. I would go further to say I want to implement ideas and problem solve by knowing tooling and technical scope rather than come up with ideas; We are 🤷; Because getting a job is easier ; I started a business during the dot com bust.  Right now I am still working and doing investments on the side.; because i want the subsidized price for my healthcare; That sounds expensive and I don't have much money.; Going from zero to one is about as hard as getting a job. Except being at \"one\" is typically not enough to make much money. It's just the start.\n\nSo yeah that's why.; With a startup, you need an actual idea. There are many people out there that don't really want to come up with an idea, they just want to be handed tasks and do work, collect a paycheck, and then go home at night and enjoy life. Nothing wrong with that either. \n\nWith an agency, now you're taking on the task of having to run out and look for clients and especially convince companies to invest and build and do things. I would tell most of those engineers they probably will have an easier time as freelancers and contractors as opposed to starting their own kind of company. \n\nThis was the same deal I saw in web design, web development, and ux. Going on your own and opening some little shop just means you're going after small businesses that are always going to nickel and dime you and drag out projects and it becomes a constant struggle. Plus you got to spend a chunk of your time doing the actual work, and then another chunk of your time running out and trying to get more work. It's just easier to have a job somewhere and do what you do without having to do the rest. \n\nThe FED decided not to raise interest rates, so that's a good thing. It's hopefully going to put a little more confidence in the money people to start investing in new products and ideas as opposed to just hanging on to everything and waiting for some magical day to happen. Then you're going to see people getting hired again. \n\nI also have to throw it out there that it sucks to look for a job in this market right now, but a lot of what seems to be going on right now doesn't seem a whole lot different than when the Great Recession happened. Doesn't even seem a whole lot different compared to when I was unemployed in 2019, and the economy was supposedly great. I spent months sending out resumes and getting nothing until suddenly. One day I started getting calls. I always keep bringing up how I would get calls about resumes I sent 12 months ago when I was already in my new job. \n\nI know this doesn't help when you have bills to pay, but you can clearly see a lot of companies are very slow and very ridiculous in their recruitment process. People can either quit the field, or they can just slug it out and things will eventually pick up again.; It's really difficult to run a business.\n\nI've had an Amazon resale side business for 10 years. It's not customer facing and doesn't require advertising, brand management or a website. I've been relatively successful  100-300k the last 3-5 years depending on my dedication.\n\nLast year I built my fiance a website, branded her practice and drove a lot of her SEO. I gave her a lot of guidance on out reach, articles, local communities to connect with etc. She's done maybe 5% of what I suggested.\n\nEven if you know what to do and you have supporting friends or partners,  it's soul crushingly difficult to become successful. Cold calling, setting up business meetings, pitching ideas, selling people on your widget is a torturous endeavor. Constantly getting turned down, flailing through attempts, Google delisting half your articles for no reason, all the while making no money. \n\nThat being said I'm quitting my primary job this fall and I'm going to make a website related to disc gulf if people are interested in pursuing a potentially lucrative side project with me. Im stuck on some of business logistics but have a good concept ready to be developed.; That typically requires capital. There isn't going to be enough capital to go around to fund tens of thousands of agencies/startups.; The SWEs with technical chops coupled with a lot of creativity and the soft skills to deliver a product solo are rarely unemployed for very long. They have too many options, including partnering up with someone to develop a new business.\n\nIt's the narrow skill ticket takers that struggle to find work when their lane gets closed. They lack the adaptability and internal motivation that a good SWE should have to survive and thrive.; It’s difficult, to get going with a product in a reasonable amount of time requires either capital or you need friends who will help with development, and most people struggle to even decide on a side project to build so the creativity involved to come up with something new can be intimidating.; Because the news and media talk about successful and at the very least mildly successful companies and businesses. No one talks about nameless businesses that countless people started and failed silently.\n\nStarting a business has risks. Most people would take out loans to start one. It’s risky to start and very time consuming even for those that already have a stable income, let alone the unemployed.; Agencies require knowing people that will pay for your services.  Just because you are \"experienced\" doesn't mean you have those connections.\n\nStartups require an idea that you fell will be something people will want to use.  Just because you are \"experienced\" doesn't mean you have a lot of companies you think make sense to start.  Never mind that starting a company requires money, which somebody that doesn't have a job may or may not have a lot of."

Need to set up a new repo? Use a template from your IDE. Forgot syntax? Let intellisense fill in the blanks\n\nMy work does not consist of writing sorting algorithms or formatting dates. I have to call undocumented APIs and interpret their results within the context of my business domain. So far, I have not seen ChatGPT produce anything helpful for that; From what I've seen, it does seem pretty good. There's no denying it. However, judging by your OP it seems you want to discuss it, but after looking at your responses to people trying to discuss it with you, all you're doing is trying to shoot them down or being kind of rude. I don't think that's very conducive for a discussion.\n\nOn topic though, you're right. It definitely is advancing faster. Do I think it'll replace developers? Who knows? I can't tell the future. It may. It could also be a very helpful tool when someone gets stuck with a task they're trying to perform as well. We just can't predict the future, unfortunately.; ChatGPT does not have the ability to reason, It \"learns\" through finding patterns. When you get output from ChatGPT on the prompt \"Make me a sorting algorithm in C++\" it is giving you back the text pattern that it mostly strongly associates with that prompt (likely some conglomeration of a couple hundred SO posts on the subject).\n\nThis means two things.\n\n1. Everything ChatGPT can tell you, already exists in some form on the internet.\n2. The place it learns \"new\" stuff from, is also the internet.\n\nIf people begin exclusively using ChatGPT for the things they used to use forums like StackOverflow and StackExchange for, these forums will die and or become inundated with AI generated content. This will clearly cause the LLM's to stagnate, unless the fundamental nature of LLM's change this is inevitable. \n\nNow Copilot is a interesting and slightly different for a couple of obvious reasons (the data source being the main one) but again the fundamental issue is it can only learn things that already exist and operates off of the principle of pattern recognition. Companies or individuals that innovate and value the novel nature of their innovations will take steps to avoid them being fed into an LLM (use something other than github). \n\nIn my opinion the outcome here is twofold\n\n1. Those who buy in fully and refuse to learn fundamentals In favour of relying on LLM's will not be contributing to the advancement of tech (which is bad for tech).\n2. LLM's will inevitably begin reinforcing themselves with their own content, causing a rise in hallucinations and misinformation.\n\nIn the short term we are going to some huge changes in the industry from increased productivity and reduced bar to entry. In the long term we are going to see an overall decrease in the quality of LLM output and thus an increase in the effort required to utilize their output, unless of course the mechanism for LLM's fundamentally changes or we otherwise achieve AGI (IMO not really possible with the current LLM architecture).\n\nYou can call it copium, but the reality is all we can do is use the most effective tools available to us, while learning how they work so we can make our best shot at planning for the future. I have software work, I use LLM's to ease my work load, but I am not counting on LLM innovation velocity doing anything but decreasing. Until I see a major breakthrough in the form of a fundamentally new way of generating AI content (not pattern matching, so not neural nets) I see no reason to see LLM's as anything other than a very efficient way of indexing and combining already known content.; ChatGPT is useless for any problem with real nuance; I use ChatGPT all the time, along with GitHub Copilot.\n\nI don't go to them for everything. But a lot of small tasks like you described are indeed much faster and more convenient. Utility functions, formatting, syntax reminders, translating from one programming language to another.\n\nThere are tons of uses for LLMs that aren't necessarily super impressive but are very convenient and can be huge productivity boosts.\n\nI find this to be a much more interesting area of LLMs, the nuance of what kind of tasks they do really well and how they fit into workflows.\n\nThere are two extreme positions that get repeated ad nauseum, and they are far from nuanced:  \n  \n- LLMs are so good that we're all going to be replaced tomorrow  \n- LLMs are garbage, they're stochastic parrots, they can't do anything; > What will ChatGPT be like in a year? \n\nThis is what I asked when it came out. It's been a year. It is still very similar to what it was like when it came out.\n\n> Literally no point in having juniors already.\n\n... and why can't jrs use chatgpt? it doesn't just write code by itself, someone still has to use it my dude.; Idk it's just lazy. I'm not a programmer professional by any means but I suspect with convenience comes complacency should people end up relying on ChatGPT to cater to their every beck and call instead of learning how to implement these things from first principles.; > Need a sorting algorithm, ChatGPT\n\nThe irony of picking one of ChatGPT's most known failures as your first example.\n\nI just asked ChatGPT 4 to write merge sort in c++. It gave me code that looks reasonable at first glance, but if you look closely it is creating two new arrays at each level of recursion which is absurdly inefficient.\n\nWhich considering the correct implementation of merge sort must exists in tens of thousands of places on the internet the fact that it still messes that up, should give you a lot of pause about everything else. But if you don't realize it is messing things up, of course you'll think it is great.\n\nI don't have copilot to test currently, but I'm pretty sure I saw a short of it making a similar mistake a couple months ago.; I used ChatGPT to try and build an SPA app only using vanilla JS. At first, it seemed like it was helping me create amazing things without any frameworks. It showed me how to do navigation and rendering based on hiding and showing pieces of the DOM through javascript. And using the History api to create client side rendering. \n\nBut as I went along, simple things like refreshing the page would crash the app, hitting the back button on the browser would crash the app. Trying to find a way to pass url parameters became a massive headache, and I was never able to do it. \n\nEventually, I realized that no amount of ChatGPT help would even be close to real knowledge about web development and javascript.  It helps with small controlled tasks where you have a clear vision of the output you want. If not, it will give you the fastest, cheapest way to solve the problem without thinking about scalability, maintainability, etc.; My favorite ChatGPT use case is giving it all the random liqours, mixers, and bitters i have leftover and seeing what cocktails I can make.; 6 yoe and your first example is “it can write sorting algorithms?”\nHow many times in 6 years have you needed to write a sorting algorithm?; It’s fine when context is small…\n\nBut engineers don’t get hired for jobs with small context.\n\nThere’s a huge difference between making a contact form & adding a contact form to a codebase with thousands of existing files while maintaining clean code.; Did you use juniors to figure this stuff out before or something? Its got its uses but definitely not replacing anyone right now.; It makes it a lot easier to be >= mid level engineer. It’s like having an assistant. I wouldn’t want to be a beginner right now though; Why do you think ChatGPT will get better but mention nothing about how much more complex the software we’ll want will be when it does?\n\nRight now, because what AI can handle is relatively simple it’s making junior and mid level engineers function more like seniors because they no longer have to struggle with the basics.\n\nOnce AI can handle the complexity of our software now, it’s not the end of software engineering, it’s just the beginning.  And, yes, the barrier to entry will be lowered as it always is when development tools advance, your average company will be capable of putting out applications with millions of lines of code, and they’ll be work to do on them.; ChatGPT is one level of complexity away from useless even now. It is great as a sounding board and quickly validating Proof of Concepts. Just this week it spat out garbage regular expressions even after repeated rephrasing and regenerating. It could not solve problems that lack sufficient documentation online. It is far from replacing decent software engineers.; ChatGPT (namely 4) is good at basic things. If you ask it to write C or rust in anything multithreading, it combusts and fails. From a business perspective, it’s ok. It generates solid ideas. It just has a poor time connecting the dots.; Dunning Krueger ass post"

There aren't any industry code or secrets for someone in your position honestly. What role will you be working in if not technical?\n\nMy advice is to start small. If it's your first time make a game and you want to make a battle royale you're going to fail. Design is king above all else. It's a game and game's have to be fun above all else.; I started a gaming startup which I eventually gave up in college. I spent nearly all my internship money (20k total lol, but it felt like an insane amount back then) to try to get it off the ground and barely made half that back\n\nGaming, as an industry, is highly reliant on product/creative direction. Make sure you hire the right people for this job. I was doing the engineering on my own but didnt hire the right creative people (artists) and our end result wasnt what I had in my vision.\n\nDo not underestimate how challenging network code can be for multiplayer games. It is way beyond the complexity of a website. Especially at scale. Your engineer needs to understand backend architecture well. My game didnt do this right, and did this with the wrong tools. I had a lot of bugs :(\n\nI’m not sure how the tools are now but the industry has matured a lot since 2017/2018 when I was doing this. Especially around network code.

Is that content really adding any value to your application? I'd think not. At the very least, look up good examples of cover letters and tweak it to sound more like those. In general, cover letters should not be that long, either -- less than a single page.; Depends on the hiring manager and the culture you're dealing with. Some do read them and hold value to them, some don't read them at all. If you have someone who does read and value them, then you're likely not getting much from using AI to write your cover letter for you. It's usually pretty easy to tell.; It'll depend on the person, but when you write something with AI, understand that it's going to look the same as everyone else who generated a cover letter with AI so it won't set you apart at all, which is the whole point of a cover letter; In 10 years of hiring, I've never seen a cover letter.

Tests are much harder and you have to prepare many months in advance, assuming you are not gifted.; Good on you for being open to feedback, that's the first step and is a difference from the vent post. \n\nI think the biggest thing is to just accept the fact that every person and every company is unique, and what one interviewer prioritizes will be completely different from what another prioritizes. \n\nSo in your interviewing journey, you have to completely detach from the outcome. That is fully out of your control what they prioritize in making their hiring decision. \n\nInstead, your goal needs to be feeling confident in interviews. If you end an interview and feel confident, you succeeded. \n\nIf you didn't feel confident, find out what part of the interview made you feel that way.\n\nThen you have 2 options:  \n1. practice that thing   \n2. seek interviews that don't screen for that thing.\n\nThen just keep iterating on that and you'll eventually reach a point where you feel confident in every interview you do, and then the job is just a matter of time.; Thank you very very much for the feedback! \n\nI do have experience with speeches and interviews (from college), so I'm not nervous at all in interviews. Maybe I still haven't found the \"one\"? Maybe it's a thing to be at the right place at the right time - to see the job post at the right time? cause there are some job posts that are uploaded only for a few hours and then they take it down (this thing happened actually with the last job I got, it was removed the next day) 🤷🏻‍♂️"

   "Top Comments": "> I have to wait for my current project to finish\n\nWhy?\n\nMost companies ask when you’ll be available to start before you even do the first interview. Of course they’d retract their offer if you lie then tell them you can’t start when you said you could, after wasting hours of their time doing your interviews.; >I have to wait for my current project to finish, which is anywhere from 3 to 5 months away\n  \nsays who? you? why?\n  \n>then some international relocation things to figure out\n  \nI've done lots of international relocation when I was in school, takes about 2-3 weeks max\n  \nI feel like there's a lot of missing info here, why do you need 3-5 month\n  \n>Will a lot of companies retract their offer if I tell them I can't start for 3-5 months? \n  \nif I'm the hiring manager, I probably will, 3 months is already uncomfortably long even accounting for visas, god knows what'll happen (whether your position is still needed) in 5 months; Why do you need to wait for your current project to finish to start the new job? 3-5 months is a long runway for a new hire to start. I'm not saying it's a deal breaker, but you should definitely just talk to them about your circumstances and work something out. But I am curious why you have to wait for your current project.; What country are you in / moving to? Are there laws around how much notice you need to put in? That's important to your question. If you're in a country where it's required to have a very long notice period of 3+ months (hypothetically, I don't know if this exists), then an employer would likely be understanding of said notice period.\n\nIf there are no laws that *legally require* you to give that long of notice, or stay at your company until your current project finishes, then that would very likely be a deal breaker. When hiring for anything other than interns/new grads, companies are usually hiring for a very specific reason that exists now, not something that's happening in 3-5 months. So they want someone ASAP.\n\nIf you're not legally obligated to, why do you want to finish your project? Is there something in your contract where there's some sort of fee or clawback if you leave early? Cause if that's the case employers would rather payout your costs than wait around for 3-5 months."

The recent demand to return to office that ends up shaving off half the workforce has had a similar effect.; It was good advice for the time; Advice doesn't have to be timeless to be good. Tons of people's lives were improved as they found a high paying career. And right up until this recent hiring market we consistently couldn't find enough qualified people.\n\nPeople are so oddly reactionary. Are you going to complain that \"invest in your 401k\" is bull every time there is a stock market downturn?; The issue with that movement was the proliferation of expensive bootcamps that preyed on naive people. I know a few people who payed thousands for a boot camp, hoping to escape either the hospitality industry or manual labor, only to realize they’re not adept at programming and there’s no realistic chance of them being able to do this day in and day out.  ; It’s still a pretty in-demand skill; I’d still give the same advice to many people. You can conform and live minimum wage or learn to code and have a chance of changing your situation at least. Not bad advice.; The learn to math and reading movement is worse.

It improved my career prospects immensely.; wym im a product of that; Ehh, it helped push me to a CS degree after highschool.

Then came growth mentality VC and the hustlebro cancer, which did fill the pockets of those who followed the advice back then, but broke the industry with another bubble.; To be entirely fair,  I also know quite a few people who DID use bootcamps to break into the industry, and who are still very happy with their career 3-5 years late. \n\n\nNot that I'm disagreeing with you about predatory bootcamps becoming a major problem.; Where are those people now?; Yep. \n\nThis sub acts like just because the barrier of entry is most likely going to be a bachelors degree and internship and they’ll have to most likely work a hybrid job that the industry is doomed forever, lmao.; Especially if you started in 2010.; Teaching kids to walk and brush their teeth led to this.

Invest in stable funds.\n\nOnce your debt is paid off and you have adequate fund, then focus on 3 and 4, and live within your means. You can accomplish them with software engineer salary.; A bunch of people on in the comments seem to be trying to live off of as little as possible and save as much of their money as they can, so I'll offer a different perspective. I'm married and our combined income for this year will be just under 400k (mostly from my salary, my wife is a yoga instructor). We are probably going to save about 130k this year. We live in NYC and rent a one bedroom. We are trying to start a family, and assuming nothing goes wrong with conceiving, we are going to have to move into a two bedroom, which is likely going to add 25-35k a year to our rent, because we don't want to move out of the city just yet. And then the baby is probably going to add another 30k a year to keep it fed /clothed/happy and pay for child care. So that 130k/year is about to fall off a cliff and become 60-70k. But that's still a 15% savings rate, which isn't amazing but it's acceptable. Even if the baby ends up costing a little more, and the we find ourselves saving less than 60k for a couple years, I'm still not remotely worried about being able to retire comfortably.\n\nI don't really buy into the FIRE mindset. I understand why people find it appealing, so I'm not saying those people are wrong, but it's not for me. Working doesn't bother me, and I like being able to spend money each week without worrying about how much that's pushing back my retirement. I like that we can go out to eat whenever we want, take trips to see our families, and that we live in a nice apartment in a neighborhood that we enjoy.; I hope you realize a lot of the replies you're getting here are people just straight up lying.\n\nBro saying he's putting away $6100/mo on a 125k pre-tax salary?

I'm at 30 and I feel like this system is rigged. I make so much yet I'm still just in debt.\n\nTo be fair my wife was in school for the last 6 years and only has been working for a year. I just was hoping it would be quicker. And those student loans take a huge hit to her wage; my partner is in school so I cover everything except grocery bills. I save in total around 600-800 a month if there are no big purchases made during the month.; $213k this year, i live with my parents and have 3 tech jobs; Currently, $2k a month to savings and 10% into my 401k.

Only subscription I got is GPT 4 and phone insurance so add another $33. Zero debt and no state income tax. \n\nIdk how much I save, I don’t budget. I get $5340 into my bank every 2 weeks after benefits and 401k. I have outrageously expensive hobbies and love to travel 10~ times a year though. I put a couple thousand a month every month into my brokerage accounts too.; I had saved a bunch.

Ideally though I’d just want to max my Roth IRA which is $7,000 this year.; Saving rate can indeed depend on a lot of factors, and I wish money literacy was taught in school, because some stuff I only learned about years after starting to work:\n\n- Debt: pay off high interest debts like credit card asap, from highest APR to lowest. High APR debt absolutely destroys your ability to save.\n\n- Recurring payments: minimize them when possible (e.g. rent w/ roommates early in your career, take the bus vs car payments, cancel subscriptions that you got in on 30-day trial and forgot about). Small habits can also become deceptively expensive (e.g. starbucks, alcohol/cigarettes, daily soft/energy drinks)\n\n- Don't just save, invest: you only need a month's worth of cash in checkings, the rest can fill a 6 month emergency fund in a HYSA or money market for easy liquidity while earning 5% APY, then any spillover after that can go into whatever investment strategy you're comfortable with. \"VOO and chill\" is a popular one these days and it means buying VOO stock units (that's a S&P 500 ETF, aka a basket of the 500 biggest companies in the US). Real estate is another popular investment vehicle, and a good choice if you're starting a family and/or lack discipline to dollar cost average every month.\n\n- You can only save so much: after some point, your money growth is going to depend largely on factors other than being thrifty. Advancing your career is the obvious thing, and younguns need to remember \"it's a marathon, not a sprint\" (and not a walk in the park either!), aka you don't want to bet the farm on some founding engineer role at a startup that ends up not working out, and you don't want to stagnate either; aim for slow and steady growth instead. Couple this with investing long term and eventually you're going to be looking at a snowball effect on your net worth, to the point you might not even *need* to save anymore."

   "Top Comments": "I will be blunt:\n\nIf you are looking for a \"traditional\" software development career, the problem is the current job market: it is bad right now and it is already oversaturated with entry-level _bachelor-degree_ people. That is right: even people who have done formal education and have a 4-year degree are struggling to get a job. This makes your situation worse because people with bachelor degrees in CS/Computer Engineering are automatically preferred over non-degree people. So if even _they_ struggle to a job, imagine what that means for you.\n\nAnd btw, you also will face the issue where you get auto rejected when applying to various places. Some companies, due to the sheer number of \"bootcampers\" applying, have started rejecting anyone who does not have a 4-year degree at a bare minimum. They literally won't even look at your resume, even if you are genuinely exceptional.; None; The ones that have what you want to learn. \n\n\nCerts aren't the quite the same in development as in other industries.  They don't qualify you for a job.  They are mainly there to teach.; Depends on your aspirations.

Do all the hands-on training and finish the course in 4-6 weeks, and see if software engineering is the right fit for you.; I've heard AWS certs are worth it; Software engineering places little value on professional certifications.  Historically the more sysadmin/network engineer track placed more significance on certs (CCNA, RHCE), although one can argue that is lessening as well.; Really depends on what you're wanting to do. But for most work, there isn't really any certs worth the time or money.

There are virtually zero accounting \"certs\" you can do online.

   "Top Comments": "[deleted]; Hey, I'm at Google and trying to move to Meta.\n\nWe have almost identical stories. I'm in my fifth year. I survived the 2023 layoffs. I went from being very high performing to middling to getting my first negative review.\n\nI'm convinced a change in environment is required - either the team or the company, but most likely the company. You can try and do FMLA, but I don't think that will solve it long term.\n\nFor me, just knowing others were going through it and that it's not a personal failing meant a lot.; Sounds a bit like burnout …; Yes, burnout.\n\nDo you have any clues as to why your manager gave you an inappropriately-large-in-scope project to begin with? I think you need to sit down with your manager and discuss this if you do not know, because what if it happens again? Maybe this all happened because your manager doesn't fully understand you as a person or what you bring to the table, so this is a good time to have a conversation about it.\n\nAlso, did you push back on the project and ultimately refuse to do it, and that is why others took it over? Because, even if a manager is a shithead to begin with, refusal to do a project does look bad from the management team's POV — even if you feel the task they assigned you isn't fair or reasonable. It is okay to push back when you know something isn't right, but outright refusal or \"project dumping\" isn't a great look and it will hurt your performance reviews.\n\nI have been in a situation like that where I was assigned a large-in-scope task. To point out it covered a large scope, I created a document where I spent a few hours and broke down the big task down into a bunch of smaller, more-digestible tasks. Then I estimated the time it would take me to do each of those small tasks. When I finished, I presented it to my manager and said, \"look, this task is technically doable, but this is what really needs to be done and this is how long it would take me, as one person, to do it.\" Then I offered the idea of collaborating with others to complete the project on time.; I'm at a smaller company, but my feeling isn't too different from yours for similar reasons. I sympathize, man. It sucks.; If you have the money saved, I'd say take a few months off. I made the mistake ( of many, pro life tip, don't give people money, particularly when they feel entitled to it) of NOT taking a long vacation I had planned. \n\nI opted to work instead and things went to hell. You should be vested now. Take the time off, visit a few counties, enjoy wine in Paris. \n\nDO NOT just jump to another job. If it's at all possible take a full year.; Move teams?;  Take the insane amount of $$$ you’ve made from Meta RSUs over the years and put it into cash-flowing assets like real estate.; > Since the start of the year things have gone badly south.\n\nSome sideways advice here would be that if you have anyone close in your life (like close friends or family) try to maybe open up and see if anyone has noticed a change in your mood outside of work. If this is legit burnout… I think it would present as either a depression or an anxiety that stuck with you most of your life. It's not confined to the 40 or (knowing how things are at FB) 50 plus hours you might be working every week. If you present with legit depression outside of your working hours then ASAP I would start speaking with a doctor or therapist and even potentially discuss a medical leave of absence.\n\nAnd then a different angle on this (and in no way meant to minimize the very real burnout and stress that probably still happens at FB) is that you might also just be kind of bored. Four years at a company like FB is four years of learning a lot of new things. Heading into year four… my guess is (I'm more familiar with the SWE side of things) there are going to be diminishing returns to how fast you are learning because you already have so much knowledge about how FB ships products.; Sorry, but OP is partly to blame. I am not saying this to be mean, but to give constructive criticism.\n\nIf your manager gives you a task, it is _your_ responsibility to understand and analyze it before you do it. If there are any concerns, you bring them up _before_ you start working on it. OP's mistake was that he started working on it and did not raise any concerns initially, so of course the (incompetent) manager thought it was an ok project. Then midway through, OP realized the scope was too large and started getting burnt out. That is when he asked for another team to take it over.\n\nIn retrospect, OP should have verified the scope of the project before starting. He should have thought about the ideal scenario (where everything goes as intended) and considered possible scenarios that could broaden the scope of the project. Then, OP should have told his manager what his plan of attack was, and mentioned possible scope issues.\n\nIf additional work gets added, you bring up possible issues too, as that work gets added.\n\nStarting a project without fully understanding it, and then backing out because you _didn't_ understand it shows extremely poor judgment. Sorry.; The most charitable interpretation of what happened is that he was trying to push me, for my own growth, and that he thought I had it in me to succeed at it.\n\nInitially the project was expected to take me a good 6 months to deliver and that would have been fine. But then it got super urgent, so at that point I pushed back hard. I got pushback from the pushback, but fortunately, others were waiting in the wings knowing exactly what needed to be done, so it was handed over by mutual agreement.; The thought of taking a year out has occurred to me many times. I’ve taken 5-8 month breaks before (pre Meta) and it was exactly what was needed.; I did consider going down the route of seeking medical leave, but... outside of work, life is pretty nice. My girlfriend and my hobby projects are sources of joy. So I don't think it's depression or anxiety. It feels much closer to boredom. I'm just not that enthused about maintaining internal tools that will never see the light of day outside the company, and as you've correctly identified, the learning process is tapering off.\n\nAppreciate the reply.; what field would you transition into if you were op?; It went something like this \n\nManager: this is our highest priority, you should own it\n\nMe: I’m not sure about that, someone else with better context should own it\n\nManager: no, it’ll be ok, and I don’t expect you to do it straight away, it’ll likely take you 6 months. The others are here to support you\n\n- a week or two later -\n\nMe: I’m really not comfortable with this assignment \n\nManager: I’m not letting you off the hook lol!\n\n- a week or two later -\n\nEveryone: this is now getting super urgent, is there anything we can do short term?\n\nMe: I have no idea!\n\nSo yeah, I am absolutely partly to blame, I should have pushed back harder to begin with, but I second guessed my gut, and assumed they knew better.; Of course I don't know your exact money situation, but from a bird's-eye view with the amount of stock Meta pays, I have to imagine you have a good chunk of cash saved up. \n\nIf I was you I would take a full year off at a minimum.

   "Top Comments": "[deleted]; I am preparing for my third and final interview for a Summer internship position after completing a 1-year internship as part of my degree course. I have prepared a list of questions I'd like to ask the engineers interviewing me. Can anyone offer advice on the questions I have so far and suggest others?\n\n* Can you describe a project or task that became a big learning opportunity for you while working here? What made it challenging?\n* Can you provide an example of a ticket or task an intern may be expected to work on?\n* Are there any good resources that would be beneficial before starting an internship here?; Hello,\n\nI am a student pursuing a CS degree, wrapping up my freshman year, I have only taken one computer class (Python). I applied for a scholarship a few weeks ago, never have l ever applied for one, they contacted me back setting up an interview today.\nDoes anyone know what I should expect/prepare for? I had to submit a tonnnn of paper work, transcripts, resume, awards, etc. so they SHOULD know the only experience I have under my belt is the one class I have taken.\n\nSomething that also worries me, I have had 3 jobs over the last 5 years, some of them overlapping, but every job I had, the employer received a recommendation from a highly respected person with that company. So every interview I have had was just basically just to be official, the job was given to me.\n\nThanks!; Is this normal?  \n  \nI was recently laid off, and so I am back at the job hunt.  One company sent me a list of \"interview\" questions for me to type up responses to in lieu of having an actual interview.  There are over 20 questions, and most of them are so open ended and unspecific that I could write more than a page in response.  I would rather not type up a 20 page report just to move forward in the interview process.  Is it normal now for this sort of thing?; If a Software I Engineer is conducting interviews for another Software I Engineer it is problematic because of gate keeping. Perhaps they won't want to hire someone who they perceive could be better or competitive with them. This has been my experience several times now where I have done an interview with people who I could tell were below my level (since I was explaining stuff to them that they didn't know or understand based on my questioning/our conversation) only to find out that I didn't pass.; I am a technichal business analyst and I was looking for a job two years ago and am looking now, my interviews in these two timeframes are like from parallel worlds. Back then I had more invitations to the second round despite zero experience, now I have nice calls aka first rounds and ghosting thereafter (from big 5 as well). I consider myself being a good BA (lots of projects and a handful of roles). I am in shock.\n\n\nI can no longer understand what's going on in HR minds. Many hiring managers seem just no longer to give a duck about the hiring process. \n\n\nMy last successfull (as I thought) face to face Interview lasted 1,5 hours and I just really looked like the best fit the company could find in the city. Still no callback in one week.\n\n\nAt this point I guess it is totally random. Maybe these days people are getting hired based solely on their looks or whatever. Or maybe noone wants to pay us the salary."

The industry is on a very steep race to the bottom that anyone with common sense should be considering an exit plan.; Tbh that’s the easier way to get a tech job. I’d say like 75% of the candidates have poor social skills and can’t communicate during the interviews. I can’t remember the last time I got an interview that didn’t lead to a job offer but I also crack jokes and try to actually connect to the person instead of grinding LC. Hell I don’t even have a degree.; Basically this. In a time when little information is given to you about why you weren’t selected, the onus is on you to identify those things. I’ve had interviews that I felt great about, felt that I’ve crushed, and after being shot down, initially I couldn’t figure out what I possibly could have done wrong. And after a few days I could dissect the coding challenge in my head. Sometimes it came down to even the smallest piece of code, and maybe not the code itself, but maybe even down to what I had been narrating over it. There’s little margin for error nowadays, so if u didn’t make it for some reason, there’s prob a reason.\n\nBut in the end, unless something changed internal to the company or the role, maybe another candidate did slightly better than you. I've come to terms with that a long time ago, and I just move on.; Huh what makes you say that ?; Go look at all the people in this forum and others saying they’d accept 60-100k for Any Job Anywhere.

The startup scene there is pretty good, and Modi is doing a good job with that imo.\n\nAnd it's still going to be really hard to get a job due to the competition there.

   "Title": "Are things we learn in school(computer science) still relevant ",
   "Top Comments": "The degree is called computer **science**. The word \"science\" in there isn't just to sound fancy. The purpose of the degree is to teach you the science of computing, including all the theoretical parts about why computers work the way they do, their fundamental principles, and their limitations. It is not a degree in programming. If you just want to learn programming, self taught or a bootcamp would suffice. But companies have shown through their hiring preferences that they value people who know the fundamentals. Languages and frameworks change all the time, but the fundamentals remain the same.; It’s pretty important to have a general understanding of how thing’s actually work, no?; Totally! I am looking into some jobs right now that would make good use of my math skills in a WebGL context (plenty of math fiddling with angles, creating special effects with shaders, and so on).\n\nThe leetcode stuff isn't the end goal. It's knowing how things work under the hood so you can make appropriate decisions.\n\nFor example, I've never had to implement a dictionary/hash set (associative array for you JavaScript folks), but I have used them a ton and know that they offer O(1) performance characteristics, but can also have a fairly substantially large \"1\". These are the sorts of things I take into account when choosing an algorithm.\n\nThat said, you can get an awful lot done without needing to know these sorts of things out of the gate. Much of it can be learned on the job as needed.\n\nAlso worth considering that just because these things are true, doesn't mean that's why they are used in contexts like hiring. Sometimes in hiring, people don't really know how to interview, and they do what they see others doing, even if it doesn't make sense in their specific context.; When I got my first job, I realised maybe 80% of the things I learned are not related to Software Development. But I remember there was a course that actually said the things I was learning was no longer useful in the real world today. Learned about vacuum tubes, turning decimals into binary, binary calculations, that CPU logic calculation (low level programming), state machines, etc.\n\nThe software dev side was also trash, people teaching you to give variable names like \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\". Why not just teach clean code at least.\n\nBut I do understand that a CS degree is not a Software Dev degree, some people actually end up going further with their studies and might find some of that stuff useful in their jobs. I once found a video of someone explaining how they compress images into JPEG and I think to be able to do that, then you need low level information and be able to use some maths to do so.; Your job doesn't require the material of a CS degree because you don't have one. If you had self-taught to become a car mechanic, your employer would not task you with designing a next-gen IC engine.

The fundamentals of how these things work isn't really changing. ChatGPT is just a really complex neural network, which is a concept developed and used since the 1940s. Most computers(not quantum computers) run on the basic 1 and 0 principle for true and false statements. \n\nThe whole reason you think that higher languages take over a lot of the tricky parts is, well, because they do. They remove a lot of complexity of understanding these complex topics, like operating systems, or databases, but if you ever want to get a job that requires knowledge of these things, well, good luck, because you can't python your way through creating a bootloader; They haven't changed that much, there's still bits and bytes in there.; KNN has a brother?; If you don’t have some foundation of things like propositional logic, OOP, algorithms, operating systems, databases, data structures, etc (all things taught in a CS degree), you’re just a monkey with a wrench; Clearly which is \"not\" needed for Machine Learning.; you speak facts bro, but on the other hand given the task to create a responsive website that handles state...bootloader knowledge is not helping; His mom had an affair with the nearest neighbor; Bro"

Still had a nice dinner.\n\nBecause we had so little in common, we turned the conversation back to one of the few interests we did share...programming. \n\nTurns out, she was a tech lead at a small startup that had just completed its first series A round and was looking to scale up its staff. We talked about the kind of work she was doing there and how they were planning to expand. Later, we talked a bit about my background, how I got started in the field, and what kind of things I was working on.  At the end of dinner, we said our goodbyes and each went our own way. \n\nShe texted me the following Monday and asked whether I'd be interested in coming to work for her company. I responded that I'd always be interested for the right money, and sent my pay requirements. She called me 20 minutes later and said the job was mine if I wanted it. I was getting burned out on my current gig, so I did. Worked there about a year and a half.; idk if crazy\n\ngot approached to fix some bug on an app through LinkedIn\n\nthen it became a company/became CTO of it (low pay big title)\n\nguy dies... go back to a salary job, that company dies damn.. all that code; Not really that crazy, but a few years ago I was heading into my final round for a position that I was so sure I was going to get since everything had been going perfectly so far. I had a meeting with the VP of Engineering of another company a couple days before that.\n\nAnyway, I missed my meeting with the VP by 3 hours because I’d mixed up the two interviews’ times. I emailed back and apologized. They agreed to reschedule, but I didn’t really care since I had the first job on lock.\n\nMonday rolls around and I absolutely bomb the final interview (wasn’t even technical at this point). I just choked. I was sad as shit that whole week up until my rescheduled call with the VP.\n\nIt turned out he liked me a lot. I then passed the technical round a week later and got the job, which paid $15k more than the first. I remember the recruiter telling me during my phone screen that his availability for interviews was limited because he was a _very_ busy man. I’m still surprised they decided to give me a second shot, especially when I fucked up so early in the interview process.; From the other end of the table, I once took a candidate through the final round of interviews for a Principal level role in \"big tech\" that I met at a park while playing with my kid.  They started idle chatting with me about work and coincidentally had a very specific skill set for an experienced role my team was trying to fill.  Came down to the final two candidates for the role but didn't get selected.; [removed]; Cold applied for an internship at a small company that posted on my school’s job board. The interview was 2 hours long consisting of the owner and VP talking about all the cool shit they’ve built (DOD geospatial contractor) and what video games we played. Started the following Monday. \n\nTurns out the company was them, one guy in Florida, and myself along with another intern. I worked there 5 years and they said they can help people who are interested in development and were just looking for people they wanted to spend 8 hours a day with. Got the opportunity to bring in a few friends when we expanded. Still miss working there.; [removed]; \"Interviewed\" on the day of an onsite corporate outdoor party and the hiring team lead was out of the office. Instead of a deep technical dive, which would have been an embarrassing disaster, I was instead asked background questions in the midst of a party. Nobody could really hear me over the noise and the term software development automation was confused with physical, system automation (industrial controls).\n\nA week goes by and I find out I am accepted and start the upcoming Monday.\n\nMy first day on the job I am staring at Python code. I don't know Python, I don't know the IDE...lol...fuck. Needless to say I worked long hours and figured things out. It was a struggle; I made so many frustrating mistakes. How I wasn't fired I don't know.\n\nI asked my former team lead later \"did you realize I didn't meet the qualifications when you hired me? I didn't have the language experience required for sure.\"\n\nHis response (paraphrased): \"yeah, we knew, but your resume indicated you were a problem solver and would figure it out. We also gave you a task nobody wanted to work on, was borderline intractible and was downright complicated, but you did far better than expected.\""

   "Title": "Should I study web development all summer?",
   "Top Comments": "Yes, study and learn projects. Don't limit your learning by college curriculum standards. A CS degree will get you past the HR bots and maybe an interview, but like you said, if you can't build a website, what good are you as a web dev? \n\nNow, of course, you'll probably have to put together a site or two for some projects, and you'll kind of know what you're doing, but if you're going to make this your career, why not start learning the craft now? Get ahead of your classes. Have a solid portfolio by the time you graduate and be able to talk shop with the people interviewing you instead of barely understanding their jargon.; Why not 15hrs learning web dev and 15 or however long you want learning Spanish?; [removed]; 20-30 hours of self studying web dev is \\*a lot\\* of hours with I'd bet quickly diminishing returns. A few hours a day might be enough to pull ahead of your peers if you're consistent.\n\nAlso why the fixation on web dev? Whether or not you can build a website is far from a useful metric on how skilled you are. Websites have an extremely wide spectrum of complexity if you consider both the front and the backend, and lots of careers focus on just the backend alone. Your awareness of careers in this industry might be limited since you're only 2 semesters in - I'd spend some time researching this area.\n\n>I'd also like to have some free time to practice Spanish every day because it's my favorite hobby. I don't think I could devote enough hours to both web dev and Spanish to make much progress if I were working and knowing me I would choose Spanish.\n\nThis is a personal time management problem you'll have to figure out for yourself. I think a 20 year old college student is more than capable of handling this :); So you think I should devote the summer to studying and not work at all?; That could be manageable. I suppose if I slept for 56, worked for 30, went to class and did homework for 30, studied web dev for 15, and studied Spanish for 15 I would still have 22 hours left. Most of my friends speak Spanish too so I won't be losing socialization and I still have the 22 left if I want to socialize more in either language.; Sorry, you do not meet the minimum sitewide comment karma requirement of **10** to post a comment.

Everything else I've seen looks too complicated and I don't like complex math and from what I can see there isn't much if any complex math required for frontend development.\n\n>This is a personal time management problem you'll have to figure out for yourself. I think a 20 year old college student is more than capable of handling this :)\n\nYeah you're definitely right.; Yes, you don't need the money from a job right now, as you said. The skills you could acquire by dedicating yourself to mastering web dev (really just programming/developing in general) will pay much more in the long run than any random job you could grab. Plus, if you ever decide it's not for you, the random jobs are still there waiting. You're in a position to become an expert in a field that could pay multiple hundreds of thousands a year down the road, and if you decided to develop and sell your own software, the sky is the limit. I recommend taking advantage of the opportunity.; First find out what you want to do, front end ? backend ? Learn frameworks accordingly. In this ai generation employers mostly look for full stack developers or developers with micro service experience. So you need to know framework(frontend or backend or bit of both for fullstack(but in fullstack make sure you get strong in either backend or frontend))+microservices+cloud deployment(docker kubernatives etc etc)holy trinity. A full fledged software with addition to unit test and version control. And also keep brushing up on dsa from time to time. Make sure every project you make is on your github.; >It's the only thing that seems possible for me to do. Everything else I've seen looks too complicated\n\nThis will get better with time and exposure. Actually, this summer might be a good time for you to get outside your comfort zone and see other flavors of software development. A well rounded skillset and flexibility is highly desirable to employers.\n\n>I don't like complex math and from what I can see there isn't much if any complex math required for frontend development.\n\nYou typically don't use complex math beyond basic algebra in day-to-day work (this depends on the area obviously). What makes you say complex math is required?; Thank you!; I need to get strong in microservices, cloud deployment, docker kubernatives, and either backend or front end plus know how to use the other one? This looks really daunting but I don't know if it really is or if it's me just not knowing how much work it takes to get good at them.; >What makes you say complex math is required?\n\nUnfamiliarity with most other parts of CS and most of my CS classes being about theory or low-level languages that I don't understand well.; A lot of these are pretty far down the skill tree...You may not encounter a lot of this stuff until your first internship. With where you're at I think focusing on comp sci fundamentals and picking up a framework or two is plenty for the year. \n\nBut if you're curious, [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/) is a good resource; Why do you think new grads aren’t getting any jobs compared to experience ones because they know this and with ai they have to do less work so companies reduced the junior staff and keep experienced ones because they know more, it is daunting but with time you’ll learn everything previously few small projects would have let you in but now in this ai gen you should know atleast concepts of this stuff coding stuff you can clear it through grinding leetcodes. The hard part is learning language and getting good with it logic building. Frameworks will come and go and microservices sounds big but its just an application divided in small parts uploaded through cloud deployment.; Gotcha, those subjects are definitely more on the academic side than they are industry-relevant. The stuff you see in tutorials is much closer to what we actually do in our jobs. You may notice there's a distinct lack of discrete algebra or differential equations in \"how to build your first react web page\". If you're looking into graphics programming, that's a different story.; Thank you!; I apologize if I come off as someone who is just whining and complaining. I just don't know if it's likely (and/or possible because programming isn't my passion anymore) that I manage to get a job before I spend so much time and get rejected so many times that I give up.\n\nIt seems to me that it is extremely hard to get a job in this field and it makes me not even feel like trying to study at all anymore. Do you know if this is true? Is it worth it to go into this field if no career interests you and you want to have a salary that is at least higher than average?; Thank you so much! I really appreciate you coming here to give me advice as a senior SE."

Now, sure, if you're talking about Big N companies those titles actually mean something, but their \"senior\" role is also not really \"just sit there and wait for the task to be handed to you\" either.; The only difference between staff and senior is you can't get away with saying \"I don't know\" as a staff engineer; You were a senior at year 2? \n\nMaybe our criteria are different, I crossed 14 years recently and feel like I can finally deserving of the tittle.\n\nI’m now a lead and miss the days when I could just do my task in peace.

   "Title": "Bad 1-1 with manager ",
   "Top Comments": "> Not sure what my next steps are and show concerned I should be now. \n\nDid your manager give you specific feedback where you're not meeting expectations? I'd start with that.\n\nI'd be pretty concerned if my manager told me my director/senior leadership thought I was a low performer for several months already. This was your manager gently telling you a PIP may be on the way if you don't step up, if it isn't already.; Number 1, your manager sucks at her job. \n\n> She said upper management has been concerned for a **few months**, so she wanted to give me a heads up\n\nBad news never ages well. This cooked in their heads for a whole quarter, that’s not much of a “heads up” whatsoever. Sounds like your manager might’ve even known about it for most of the 3 months. \n\nNumber 2, complaining about management won’t put food on your table so here’s my advice: be as genuine as possible and get actionable feedback on what they think you’re doing wrong. As ruthlessly proactive as you can be. “Your tickets take too long” is not really actionable feedback- your manager should have been helping you get to the root of the problem, *why* that happens and *how* to fix it, but she’s not doing that so you need to lead these conversations with everybody. Then you look for a better job when you’ve stabilized :); >She said upper management has been concerned for a few months now, so she wanted to give me a heads up. She’s now doubled my one-one and asked me to set up meetings with my mentor and with her manager as well.\n\nSounds like a bad manager. A good manager would have identified it early and worked with you on it. None of this \"my manager says you're not going well\". Who is really in charge of your performance?; \"upper management\" is not concerned about how fast a single junior dev is closing tickets. your manager is a piece of shit and most likely, she is throwing you under the bus for her own poor performance.; This reads like a PIP, coming your way soon.\n\nI’d polish up the CV and start to apply for new roles just in case your time with your current employer is limited.; Be fully transparent since you are saying you've been an honest worker/adamant about your abilities/workload capacity in the 1-on-1. \n\nManager is going to want a plan suggested to them for how to track you / keep any eye on you. If you've got a tech lead / lead sr. I would suggest suggesting that going forward you document start/finish times for tickets and any blockers / escalations to your lead on a timesheet/worksheet of some sort that you will review with her at those 1-on-1's and then ask that she schedule (& you document the occurrence/frequency of) subsequent 1-on-1's with your tech lead / lead sr. who's doing approval on these tickets/supposed to be overlooking you for direct feedback to her in separate privacy about your performance going fwd. \n\nThat's really the best you can do other than speeding it up if that's even something ur able to do within whatever free time to learn more efficiencies for doing your job.\n\nA key problem for these sorts of situations (but not\\* one I'd counsel bringing up as I think it's subjective/unsolvable) is the difficulty of each of these tickets / an individual ticket which may be impacting negatively your time-to-delivery/completion. But I'm not confident that's an angle you can argue/prove, hence my hesitance in even suggesting u bring it up. \n\nOne workaround might be to granulate the time it takes you per ticket and average out the numbers to hopefully prove on average you are a good performer, and than discuss the onesies or twosies that might have taken longer than usual and the a deep dive into the reasons.....but I leave that up to you if u wanna dive into that rabbit hole.\n\nOther than that.....its always good to keep ur resume/feelers for lateral or external job opportunities if you can. (The problem might not** truly be 'you'......) Apologies that's what I can offer and best of luck/wishes; First, it is important to recognize that this is not your fault. If they had certain timeline parameters, they could have clarified it right from the get go. They didn't. That's their fuck up. As a result, you were flying blind for months. It is like playing a video game where the rules got arbitrarily yanked on you. Management is at fault.\n\n\nSecond, if the tasks required certain urgency, they could have come to you sooner - as soon as they learned of that urgency. They could have explained the \"why\" behind the urgency - e.g. marketing team needs this by this date. They have even staffed your work with more people. They could have removed roadblocks for you. Did they do that? No. So it is clear that your management is dysfunctional and doesn't realize that it is their job to help the execution - not to boss the execution. Engineering cannot be done faster just because some random detached management ladder wants it.\n\n\nThird, in practice, a lot of companies have a pre-pip. You are likely already targeted and are being set up for failure. They are likely trying to get you to miss a milestone. If you complete all milestones, they could still frame you with any other arbitrary thing. It's a lose lose battle that is going to affect your mental health. I personally would have not changed a thing about my work but would have started applying elsewhere.\n\n\nIt is sad but these are the patterns of poor corporate structures and poor  management. Don't blame yourself for what is poor management.; Welcome to being a software dev where managers are pretty much useless lol. I say that sarcastically, but there's some truth behind it. Unfortunately it sounds like you got a real shit one.\n\nIf you are completing tickets on time, then there's no need for concern. If they aren't giving you more tickets or difficult tickets due to concerns, then I'd ask what gave them that impression, and see if you can handle more or more complex ones to show you are fine.; Ive now been working in this field for 10 years. My SIL has been a dve manager for most them I asked her about PIPs. She said, if its a surprise, you have a bad manager. I agree with another post.; manager here, here;s what i would do.\n\nTake control of the situation, go through Jira/whatever ticket system you use, and make a simple report of how many story points you've done for the past sprints, and ask her how much more you're supposed to do. Perhaps she wants you to do the same stories but just quicker.\n\nWhatever the outcome, you don't want to feel not in control, so use the data that management cares about and get out ahead of it.; You're fucked. Start looking for a new job.; If you’re not above average on your team you’re always in danger. This is even true when you’re a Jr dev. \n\nHonestly it’s a good time to start looking for a job to line up for the one year mark, that’s probably going to be their decision point.; My first job didn't give me any sign of underperforming until they fired me lmao so at least you got a bit of a warning. I'd say just make sure you communicate well with the people who are actually important/relevant (team lead, PM..) to make sure you know where exactly they would like to see improvement.; Start looking for a new job now! This smells like shit and my impression is that your manager is trying to either get you to quit or set you up. Don’t leave without another job because you’ll lose your unemployment and severance.; Best thing to do is job hop at this point. Don't trust that any amount of good faith effort on your part will actually reverse their thinking. It's possible, but not guaranteed and therefore you're at risk at this job.; [removed]; [removed]; [removed]; Tell your manager to fuck right off, then go to her manager and tell her to fuck right off too.

As far as working on personal projects, you'll have to do it in your spare time.

Luckily I'm starting to get some coding in at the job and my job title is still \"software engineer\" so I may just leave it that way, and then in the actual interview if they ask I'll explain that I was doing software engineering for test related dev (like I thought id be doing when I accepted the job lol)"

I supported her through school so I know pretty well how hard and how much it costs and how much it pays.; Just bc your r wife is a doctor, that doesn't mean you've done patient care, or consoled a mother that her son died in a motorcycle accident. Telling me I should go do 13+ of school for something I don't really have an interest in, simply bc YOU don't like your situation in your current career isn't viable. There is a major difference between supporting someone, and actually working in the trauma room, or diagnosing patients. \n\nIf you really think this, why don't YOU go get your Paramedic license or become an RN?; I'm not sure what your problem is. YOU asked for advice, I gave you respectful advice and twice you came back with attitude.

   "Title": "What annoys you about interns?",
   "Top Comments": "I know of some interns who have gotten fired:\n\n* Medium sized company, 4 months in. EVP overheard them say \"I could work here for a decade and still have no idea what we do lol\". Short investigation revealed they didn't do anything\n* Big company, 3 months in. Masters student used the nap room everyday. Got transferred between a few teams before getting fired\n* Small company, a few weeks in. Intern showed up and left on their own times\n\nFor the most part, as long as you make an effort to learn and contribute, there is nothing to worry about. Your full time peers expect you to be bad, but not arrogant or super lazy; Not asking questions and getting stuck OR asking questions that can be easily googled\n\nFirst, try to resolve the issue yourself. If you get stuck after 30 min - an hour or if it's some company / codebase specific thing, just ask; Not asking questions because I look busy.\n\nI get it you don't want to disturb me, but when I tell them that they can ask me questions any time I really mean it.  I had a shit internship experience back in the day and now I always make sure to be available to interns.  I'll even make it a point to check in with them twice a day.  Once in the morning and again before they leave for the day.; 1. Being an asshole\n2. Poor work ethic\n3. Lacking openmindedness or curiosity\n\nProbably in that order.; I had a team lead/mentor at my first job that was a very helpful and patient man. Only time I ever saw him lose his patience was with an intern. He would explain how something should be done and the intern would argue. All the time. \n\nYou're there to learn, so learn. Don't waste time arguing minutiae with devs that have 20 years of experience when you are still in school.; I had one intern I was responsible for mentoring who was assigned a small project to complete during her 3-month internship. She came from a great school and our company was prestigious, so I figured she'd be super motivated.\n\nWeek after week goes by and she gives me the same excuse about her getting started. Then she goes on some kind of trip with her friends to a rave or some week long event. It's been a month at this point with no progress.\n\nAt this point I'm starting to get worried because her failure is going to make me look bad too, plus it's my responsibility to mentor her. I kept asking about her progress and she'd give me vague answers. This went on for another 2 weeks, and at this point we have 1.5 months left.\n\nI finally just sat down with her and asked her to show me what she had. She hesitated but finally showed me... Nothing. She'd done basically nothing in her 1.5 months. She was super embarrassed and I'm pretty sure she was about to cry.\n\nAsked her what was going on and it turns out she just didn't even know where to start, and I guess that as time went on she was afraid to show that she had no progress which created a bad cycle.\n\nI told her I'd help her and we'd get this working. We started spending like 3-4 hours together every day side by side pair programming. Later I'd do my work right next to her and answer her questions. We were basically glued to each other, we'd even leave for lunch together lol. After like 2 more weeks she had it down and knew exactly what to do and how to learn what she didn't know. She ended up completing the project and leaving a good impression.\n\nAnyway lesson there I guess is don't procrastinate, and also your mentor is a mentor for a reason.; >\"Thanks for the advice, but I plugged it into ChatGPT and it told me to do this. Oh, by the way you can get around the company ChatGPT firewall by doing...\"\n\nI gave an intern a task that was open ended with a number of ways to solve it. My intention was for it to be a small contained interesting fun problem that they could do, with the ultimate goal of them learning about the topic. My goal wasn't for them to solve the problem, it was for them to learn. And they had a solution that worked, but they didn't understand anything about it or why it worked. So they were able to solve the problem without learning. That was the most taken aback I've ever been. Really opened my eyes to how things are changing.\n\nIn my experience no one really expects anything from interns. If considering the time I sink into helping you, things come out as a wash in productivity, that's a win in my book. Don't worry so much about your productivity so much. \n\nIf your mentor is good, make sure to tell his/her boss that they are doing a good job and you appreciate it. In my experience people mentoring still have to do all of their normal duties, so it can kinda be like charity for the person mentoring, taking out of time they have away from work. If they are doing that, then mentoring likely means something to them. Just like you want to do a good job, some mentors want to do a good job as well (not all). To move up in a corporate ladder you need to start overseeing things, and if someone is applying for a promotion in the future, their experience of mentoring is likely something that they would use to argue that they are fulfilling those types of roles. So if you think they are doing a good job, let their boss know because for some people it actually could be something that's beneficial to them.; I’m leading a team of interns while also working on other projects and this post has honestly made me feel bad about myself. I’m very patient with them and I’m 100% available for any of their questions - however, there is one intern I’ve just started ignoring on teams. They spam me with every cool thing they find about C#, or they pick apart a built-in function and tries to explain why it’s built poorly (it’s not, they just don’t understand the documentation) \n\nHow do you guys deal with these people aside from directly telling them they’re being annoying? I love that they’re learning and getting excited about code, but I’ve got my own projects, I don’t have time to read 7 paragraphs explaining C# to me.; Not being pleasant to work with. They're still in school. I get not knowing stuff. I get working that 1 day ticket for a whole week. Hell, I get not knowing what to even google. But it takes almost no effort to be a nice person.; Asking vague questions -- don't send me vague screenshots with only half the logs and expect me to know what's wrong\n\nIf you run into an issue, share all relevant details (log files, set up/environment details, the command you ran) when you ask for help. Be as specific as you can. It takes 2 times longer to debug if I have to pull all the details out of you; This applies to everyone and anyone in any occupation. Stop being unpredictable and BE a predictable person. I’m not saying don’t think out of box or don’t break status quo. But don’t be unpredictable pos that does stuff without telling anyone.; If you show up (or are available if WFH) and are around for the entire time, you're already part way there.\n\nSecond up - get some work done and show some progression. Be receptive if feedback and ask questions.\n\nI generally expect very little from 4 month interns. 12 and 16 month are useful. First 4 is getting up to speed. The second 4 is getting productive; last 4, they are basically juniors.\n\nAfter a year they normally have enough confidence and knowledge to question some of the more ridiculous requests.\n\n...\n\nFor larger teams I expect some of the \"senior\" interns to help onboard the newbies. It is very handy to be familiar with the initial growing pains when explaining things.; The best interns I’ve had would ask questions when they were stuck, would be appreciative of the help, would ask for and take feedback seriously. The worst seemed to resent their hosts, thought they knew better, and would either not ask for help or ask without having done the preliminary work themselves.; Have a go at it yourself even if you have no idea. After an hour then go ask questions or for help; They want to refactor/rewrite literally everything. Miss that passion; Not much. The only thing that really annoys me is when interns insist they're right about something when it's clear they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. I don't mind constant questions or slow progress. That's expected. The biggest mistake I see interns make is spinning their wheels for days on end trying to figure something out for themselves when they should really just ask.; This is pretty universal regardless of experience but I expect people to put in at least 5 hours a day, you can tell when people aren’t even doing that. As an intern, try your hardest to work 8 hours and try to make at least 6 of those hours focused work. Uninstall reddit from your phone.; The key with being an intern is learning HOW to ask questions. Approach people with “I searched the documentation, I made an attempt, and I’m still not sure.” Now, some people will still be ass holes about it - the industry is riddled with those types of people. However, the key is to seek out the people willing to help and gather feedback from them. Always try to improve. If you can do that some will respect you. And finally, don’t forget that this is an internship - you won’t work with these people for a long time so be prepared to build relationships with the people that matter most for YOUR career.; broadly speaking, I like working w/ interns a lot... in undergrad I studied Mechanical Engineering and had one \\_really\\_ crappy internship, and one \\_ok\\_ one... I've been fortunate to work w/ multiple awesome interns recently.  I think the biggest challenges that interns face is dealing with isolation and how to manage the differences in experience ... as u/ernandziri said, there are two extremes that can be annoying if you're working with interns.  Asking someone a questions regularly that are easily searchable, or not asking for help and being stuck on something indefinitely.  After you get your dev environment setup and start doing something resembling work product, when you get stuck, give yourself a fixed time to try and resolve whatever issue you're on.; One annoying thing I'm dealing with right now is that he's just waaay to over motivated. Even if told he should focus on finishing one task a day, he's wildly jumping between tickets, half assign and not really testing anything and then gets 5+ tickets back the next day.\n\nI understand a lot of domain knowledge is needed to test the things correctly, but it's provided to him and he should ask if more info is needed. \n\nIt's like I ask him to pick up a flow from the forest and he goes in with a chainsaw and brings a few tree lodges.\n\nHost of the time I end up reverting so much that didn't even need to be changed."

   "Title": "Going for Bachelors #2",
   "Top Comments": "You can apply for a MS in Computer Science even if your original degree is not STEM. You'd just have to take a few prereqs. MS can also be considered in lieu of 1-2 years of work experience.; Many schools offer post bacc options for CS programs.  More common is Masters in CS, which is basically second bachelors, as they have pretty much same CS curriculum.  There are also more remote options, night school options, etc.; I went back as I didn’t qualify for doing the traditional “go back for a MS in CS” due to a low GPA my first go around in a STEM degree due to personal issues (BS in Chemistry 2.54 GPA).\n\nAfter going through the same thought process as you are, I ended up choosing Western Governor’s University (WGU) as my school of choice. The school is regionally accredited, and the BS in CS program is also ABET certified. \n\nI was able to complete my degree as a full time working adult in less than one term (6months as opposed to the traditional fall/spring semesters), and it cost me around $4k for the term ($4k for each term). You can complete as many classes as you possibly can, allowing you to accelerate and finish courses that come naturally to you faster and you can take courses at your own pace.\n\nAfter graduating at the end of 2023 I applied and received a remote job offer for an entry level SWE role starting at $85k with a bonus. I made an entire post about my journey on the r/WGU sub Reddit. \n\nFeel free to read and DM me if you have any questions, and Goodluck on your journey!\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/s/4Vnam7JHi7; I’m currently doing the postbacc compsci degree at Oregon State University. It’s been a great experience so far! Super flexible program, only a few prerequisites beyond a bachelors degree, and the quarter credit system has allowed me to do the program in right at a year.\n\nI’ll say that I was able to leverage my background in financial software implementation to get an internship with a financial software company. Otherwise, I haven’t had much luck in internship hunting. Also I’m on the east coast and most of the career opportunities for OSU are on the west coast (naturally), so something else to consider.\n\nTotal cost of the program is right around the $30-$35k mark depending on what classes you come in with; I have a bachelors in electrical engineering and went back to get one in computer science. My schooling was mostly free or I’m not sure I would have done it though. Just took me 2 years roughly since I didn’t have to take any gen eds really. Didn’t want to go for a masters because I’m not about doing all of those research and thesis type stuff, I don’t ever plan to go that route lol ; Oh cool, hadn’t considered that!; Wow that sounds super similar to the spot I’m in. Gonna look into that, thanks for taking the time to share!; Any negative stigma from being from WGU?; Nice, thanks for taking the time to share!; Not a single interview I’ve had has brought up any sort of negative stigma or downgrading WGU. Maybe it happens to others, but anecdotally it didn’t happen to me."

   "Top Comments": "Make that decision after you've tried to apply for positions and seen how the market responds.; If you're worried about getting a job, why not brush up on more employable skills? Build some interesting projects that utilize things like AWS and Azure. You can just look at job postings, see what skills employers want, and work on those. A competitive market doesn't mean an impossible market.\n\nAlso, if possible, get an internship. That's way easier than getting a new grad job.; are you in it just for a job?\n\nor are you in it for interest\n\ndoesn't need to be binary, but be honest which one it leans towards; If you’re a new grad or trying to break into the space I’d recommend getting off this sub mainly because it’s an eco chamber of fear about the job market. \n\nWhile there is a big flood of remote employees at the moment that doesn’t mean your can’t get a job for example I sent out maybe 30 resumes got 6 interviews and got 5 offers. So while the market is inflated I’d say it’s not totally out of the question.\n\nIf you really want to stand out from the other candidates I’d really recommend working on your personal skills, a lot of people can code but not a lot of people can communicate effectively so when I interview candidates poor social skills is almost always a DQ. Another thing is I’d try to stay local untill you have some experience so you can use the fact you’re not remote to your advantage.;  I’m confused as to how that relates with my post.\n\nThough to answer your question, I would say it’s both, I love working on tech-related projects. The problem is that interest alone does not pay the bills. \n\nI do acknowledge that money is the reason that the tech industry is oversaturated. \n\nOverall, I’m not demanding a six figure salary plus stock options and bonuses, all I’m asking for is how can I make an adequate living working in tech (most likely in a freelance position) and gain years of industry relevant experience."

Never been an issue.; I'd check with some folks about this beforehand. Some companies don't care, some companies are very strict about what you do on your work machine, including what services you use, software you install, etc. Talk to people who would be able to tell you the policy, then it's in your best interest to stick to that policy.; Nope; Depends on the policies of your work and the specific services being used. Spotify? Personal. GitHub? Maybe work, if that's what they have set up.; Look for your company's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).  And if it isn't clear, ask the security department.  They would rather you ask then do something that might get you in trouble.; to be safe, you shouldn't for any social media or email stuff. But I always do so I'll tell you the 2 methods I've done in the past.\n\n1) If you're hell bent on just using chrome I make a separate email that is myname.companyname@gmail.com. I keep all of my work stuff in chrome there and when I want to use my own personal things, I open a new window or incognito window and then sign in to my personal stuff, usually when I'm on break.\n\n2) Separate concerns with your browsers. I usually use chrome for work because i'm most familiar with their dev tools and then I use firefox for my personal. you can still create an account that syncs across devices like chrome does.\n\nEither way I don't combine the 2 different accounts as much as possible for my own sanity. If they are ever like hey you can't do that then I can just sign out of my personal stuff from the browser and all good. But I'd ask a co worker who has been there for a year or so honestly and see what they say. HR and upper management will just tell you don't do it.; I have never logged into a personal account on a work computer and I never will. Anything I would need I can access on my phone; You need to make the decision for yourself. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it but I've had no problem doing it in my 16 years.; My rule of thumb: would I be ok if my boss was looking at it from behind?

Company policy is different, but here whatever side project I do if I do it on company property (like the work laptop) or during company time it belongs to them. My side projects aren't anything special and probably will never take-off, but better to be safe.; “Of course! What could go wrong?” - Hillary Clinton; Keep as much personal stuff as possible completely separate from work stuff. GitHub is probably the only account I’d share with work activity. Remember your company probably logs every single thing on your work computer.; I don’t do it.; If it ain’t work related. Don’t.; As others have said, it depends on your company’s policy.  But I would personally not log in to anything besides something like Spotify or your email, assuming you don’t use that email for anything inappropriate.  Reddit/YT/FB/etc are a no go.; Common knowledge says no. Meaning Reddit will say no. But in many cases, it's very convenient and completely safe. I do it and it's never bitten me. Just keep it minimal. If you post porn on your Reddit, don't log into your Reddit.; No. Nothing personal.; I try to avoid as much as possible, but a few things are very hard to live without.\n\nAccess to my personal Google Calendar is one of those thing.  And access to LinkedIn is really useful for looking up people I'm about to interview."
